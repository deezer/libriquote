6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_53|“How so, O my lady? Who dare speak such word?
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_54|“Verily, this is a calamity which is fallen upon us, and I know not whence this young man came to us!

6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_64|“And could no one do thine errand?
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_65|“No, for I went to acquaint him of that which hath befallen me with yonder cur of a merchant, so he might lay hands on him and on all the merchants of his bazar and crucify them over their shops nor suffer a single foreign merchant to tarry in our town.
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_66|“Yes, but I found him absent a-hunting and sporting and now I await his return.
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_67|“I take refuge with Allah, the All-hearing, the All-knowing! Praised be He! O my lady, thou art the most sensible of women and how couldst thou think of telling the King these fond words, which it behoveth none to publish?
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_68|“And why so?
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_29_burton_64kb_69|“Suppose thou had found the King in his palace and told him all this tale and he had sent after the merchants and commanded to hang them over their shops, the folk would have seen them hanging and asked the reason and it would have been answered them, ‘They sought to seduce the King’s daughter.’
6773.thousand_nights_vol07_28_burton_64kb_0|“Return thou to form of man.

4062.mrwhickerswindow_17_dawson_64kb_28|"Look, sir! Here is the sandbar, and here
4062.mrwhickerswindow_17_dawson_64kb_29|"the Venture. Or she was, yesterday. Now sir, the sandbar being just below and ahead of the Venture, once the Mirabelle has slipped by, wouldn't it be too bad if something happened to make the Venture drift with the tide and run aground?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_0|"fleck!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_1|"Ah, now!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_2|"and where have you been, I wonder?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_3|"It is true, you have a tiny mark at the side of your jaw -- if parakeets have jaws, my friend. But there is no such thing as magic. Not the kind of magic whereby a human can be something else!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_4|"What a joke if it were possible! Now what could I be, eh?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_5|"Haw yourself!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_6|"Now, all this is a most engaging train of thought,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_7|"If I could change myself, what should I be?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_8|"Ah -- there you are at last, Claggett,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_9|"Battle all over? It still sounds rather ferocious, to me. But of course I am no expert. Heaven forbid!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_10|"I will have that bird, Osterbridge,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_11|"Oh no, you will not, Claggett,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_12|"This is the one thing that is keeping me from unutterable boredom, while you go into your interminable fight.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_13|"I am not a trader, Osterbridge. Nor shall I bandy words with you on this subject. Give me that bird, or I shall take it from you!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_14|"Claggett,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_15|"I am sorry to say such a thing to you, but your fever during the weeks just past has undoubtedly altered your brain. You are a madman, Claggett.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_16|"Kindly leave the room, Claggett,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_33_dawson_64kb_17|"until you are more yourself. Your conduct and tone are unbecoming to a gentleman,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_0|"We'll take a look at the Mirabelle,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_1|"See there, the thin man. That be Mr. Mason's agent. I heard he's here to buy the ballast bricks for his master's plantation on the island."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_2|"Ballast bricks? Please sir, what's that?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_3|"Ballast bricks? Why, anyone knows that these are the bricks brought over in the hold, my lad, should there not be sufficient cargo, both to make ballast for the vessel and to sell once here. English bricks are cheaper than those we can make ourselves. Did you not know, young man,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_4|"that our bricks for building houses have all come from British kilns?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_5|"No sir, thank you sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_6|"The Mirabelle!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_7|"I'd know those lines anywhere!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_8|"a taste, a mere spoonful
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_9|"Eh well, lookee here!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_10|"Chris and Amos, by me soul!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_11|"Lookin' about, lads? Eh, that's the way. Is she not the finest ship that ever ye did rest your eyes on?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_12|"Who in the world are they?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_13|"Them? Why, bless me cap and buttons! That-there's the captain of the Mirabelle no less, and his first mate. Captain Ezekial Blizzard, he is, and Mr. Elisha Finney,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_14|"Blizzard and Finney, that's them,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_15|"And a better captain and first mate is not come by in the whole land, I shall warrant you. He may look too plump for his own good,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_16|"Mr. Finney's kind, too,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_17|"though he don't look it, bless me cap and boots! He's tenderhearted as a bird, under that gloom, is Finney."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_18|"Could we go on board the ship?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_19|"No, me lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_20|"'Tis better not. Wait till the master do present you proper to the Captain, for the Mirabelle is Captain Blizzard's castle, like. I would sooner ye were asked aboard by him."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_21|"Come now! Cheer up!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_22|"Come meet some of the crew!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_23|"Here are two likely young 'uns, living at the house of Mr. Wicker. Ye've heard me speak of them. Amos, here, on me right, and Chris, that's on me other side.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_24|"this good man here is Bowie."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_25|"This here's Elbert Jones,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_26|"and that one's Abner Cloud, and that one,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_12_dawson_64kb_27|"that one's Zachary Heigh."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_0|"Golly Moses!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_1|"Fancy dress, huh?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_2|"Oh my golly!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_3|"and it just set me off. I hope I didn't disturb you?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_4|"Well now. So you are awake at the last, eh? And hungry, bein' a boy, I don't doubt?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_5|"So you are Chris, did you say? Christopher, that would be? And I am Mistress Rebecca Boozer, should you be wanting to know. Becky Boozer, they call me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_6|"Eat up now, young man,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_7|"for Mr. Wicker will be wanting to see you when you have done. It's late. Past eight of the clock.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_8|"It might be just possible that Master Cilley will be passing by before long for a midmorning snack and here I am gossiping with you instead of getting on with my work."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_9|"Don't you have an icebox?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_10|"What may that be?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_11|"To keep the food cool,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_12|"We have a larder on the cool side of the house, if that be what you mean,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_13|"Keeps the food pretty well up to April or May. Then the heat makes everything go. Oh! This heat! Prosperity, Maryland, where I come from, and on the sea coast as it is, was never like this!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_14|"If you had a little wooden trough that led from that tub out through the window there, you could pull out a bung when you were ready and the water would run outdoors. It would save you carrying that great tub about, when you are in a hurry."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_15|"I would never have thought it,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_16|"by the look of you. Never in this world. You have brains, young lad, that's what you have. A better idea than that I never heard! Indeed, it is just what I have been a-needin' since years, and that simple I might have thought it out myself! I shall set Master Cilley to work on it when he comes. He's right handy with tools, is Ned Cilley."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_17|"Come now, Becky me love!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_18|"How can I start the day right 'thout a kiss from my Boozer?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_19|"Get along with you, Cilley! What a way to behave,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_20|"See -- there's company here."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_21|"A visitor, eh? Well, well. Off a ship?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_22|"No -- no!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_23|"from another part of the country. He got here last night and slept late, as you see."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_24|"Indeed and indeed!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_25|"Well, young man,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_26|"I shall sit here, Mistress Becky, by your leave,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_27|"to keep this lad company, as it were."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_28|"So you shall!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_29|"And could I tempt you with a morsel, Master Cilley?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_30|"How could I refuse when I know your fame as a cook?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_31|"But a crumb, Mistress Becky. A morsel. A taste. Just to pay my respects to your art, as it were."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_32|"Just a morsel, Master Cilley,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_33|"Try just a taste, to please me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_34|"Here -- try this,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_35|"You must keep your strength up, Ned Cilley,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_36|"for 'tis a hard life that you lead,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_37|"Aye, that it is, that it is!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_38|"A hard life, has a sailor,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_39|"Mistress Boozer,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_40|"I am a new man.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_41|"You have saved me again. Ah! Mistress Becky, what a treasure you are!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_42|"That will be the master,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_43|"I shall be back, Master Cilley! I pray you, do not leave!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_44|"Please, Master Cilley,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_04_dawson_64kb_45|"Why does she wear that queer hat?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_0|"Men, you have followed me for many a voyage and I have always brought you safely home. Is it not so?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_1|"What lies ahead of us in the next few hours will not make good sense to many of you. Nevertheless I ask for your instant help, and you shall see what lies at the end of my orders when we reach that time. Are you with me?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_2|"Well and good,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_3|"I thank you. Now crowd on all the sail she will take, boys, for the Venture follows hard upon us!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_4|"It would be my advice, lad, to go below and sleep for a bit. You too, Amos. I shall send Ned to awaken you when land is sighted."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_5|"Best eat up, lads,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_6|"and join the Captain, sez he to me, for land is just ahead and the Captain do be waiting you on the bridge, Chris, me lad."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_7|"Impossible to tell how close behind the Venture may be. We have come quickly, but they have the faster ship. I have no wish to give them more clue than necessary as to where we may be.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_8|"Land is off the starboard quarter, and Abner Cloud is out on the bowsprit looking for the reef. We have passed our anchorage -- they expected us, or some other ship, for fires were lit on shore. Sail has been taken in; we are going slowly and will soon be there, by my reckoning."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_9|"May I go forward and be with Abner?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_10|"and hurry. Happen your eyes are sharper than Abner's. Sing out when you spy the reef. We will heave to, and then God be with you, my lad, to find us out the channel to the cove!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_11|"Heave-ho!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_12|"Drop anchor, lads!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_13|"I've found the channel, sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_14|"There's a dangerous shelf of coral that juts out on the port side -- if you let me go first, and the men man the boats and row her in, I think we shall do it safely even in this light."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_15|"Well lad, we do what we must, and you and I understand one another. Ahoy there!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_16|"Man the boats! We shall tow the Mirabelle to cover, for there's a channel here!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_17|"Now Christopher, my boy, do you go down and go over the side again, and remember what we spoke of a few hours agone!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_18|"The length of two boats, keeping to starboard, boys. Then ease her over this way -- to port."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_19|"My good lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_20|"you said you could do it, but truth to tell, I doubted it from the bottom of my heart. Now that you have succeeded where I am sure no other could have done as well, I find I have no words of praise good enough for ye.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_21|"I am proud of you, Christopher. You did a man's task with a boy's body and mind. And it took a man's spirit, too."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_22|"Now, me boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_23|"do you go to your well-deserved rest. Depend upon it, we shall cover the ship with green until she looks like the proverbial Christmas hall decked with boughs of holly, as the song goes!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_22_dawson_64kb_24|"A little later in the day you shall be called to see what you make of the result. And now, to bed with ye both!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_0|"what has happened here? You all look angry and somewhat a-frighted. What occurred, Ned?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_1|"But truly sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_2|"I never saw anything like Osterbridge Hawsey before. He's a dilly!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_3|"What a fortunate coincidence that I happened by just at this time,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_4|"and that I have with me such an excellent ointment.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_5|"This will help to stop the bleeding, my boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_6|"and take away the pain. It hastens the cure,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_7|"In an hour you will scarcely know it happened,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_8|"I have set you too great a task, my poor Christopher, for you are but a boy.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_9|"You are a boy, but what lies before you is a man's task, and no mistake. You cannot in the future allow yourself the luxury of such childish enjoyments as a laugh at Claggett Chew, or his friend!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_10|"I know that now sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_11|"I asked for trouble that time."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_12|"Yes,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_13|"You did. Too bad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_14|"The laughter you could not resist has meant that you came forcibly to Claggett Chew's notice in such a way that you will never be forgotten.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_15|"I saw it happening while I was in my study, but could not warn you in time,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_16|"So I came down with the ointment for your poisoned wound."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_17|"Poisoned wound, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_18|"Yes. Sometimes Mr. Chew has a way of wiping poison onto the metal tip of his whip. It is a slow poison -- it does not take effect for days or weeks. In fact, so long after his lash that no one attributes the whip cut to the death that finally follows. Never fear,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_19|"the ointment I have put on will take care of that too, and your cut will be closed and healed before the day is over. What is unfortunately more lasting,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_20|"is Mr. Chew's memory. Well
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_21|"there's no help for what is done. Use caution in the future, Christopher. That is all I ask."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_22|"I shall, sir!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_23|"Enjoy yourself the rest of the day, my boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_24|"But be constantly on the alert and look in all directions. Here,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_25|"take these few coins in case you should need them. Now find Amos, and be off with you!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_26|"What you-all looking for?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_14_dawson_64kb_27|"Just something I hoped I'd find,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_0|"Old Wicker's got a sign in his window -- he needs a boy. For after school, I guess. Think he'd pay, huh? Whyncha try?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_1|"Oh -- I don't know."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_2|"Well, I'll tell you what. Know who needs a job bad? That's Jakey Harris. His mother's sick, and he's got that bad foot. Whyncha ask for him, huh? You sit next to him at school."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_3|"Only why didn't you ask him yourself?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_4|"I did. Wicker's such a queer old guy. That ol' antique shop is dark an' spooky, an' -- Well, I went in, and there wasn't nobody there, on'y him and me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_5|"So I said I was there about the job, an' do you know what he said? He said
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_6|"He said, 'Turn around and look out that window, son, and tell me what you see.'"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_7|"Everybody knows what's outside his window!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_8|"Of all the silly things! But I turned around and looked, like he told me to, and of course there was the traffic goin' by, and trucks, and cabs, and people crossin' the street, and the freeway overhead, an' -- you know."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_9|"So what did he say?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_10|"Oh, he just smiled, that funny little crackly smile, and said, 'I'm sorry, young man, you won't do.'"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_11|"Queerest thing I ever heard. Gee! Whaddaya suppose?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_12|"It doesn't make sense, but old Wicker's so old he may be addled, don't you reckon? Who else would keep an antique store where nobody ever looks? All the other antique places are along Wisconsin Avenue where people go to shop."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_13|"You reckon Jakey really could use the job?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_14|"Think he really needs it?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_15|"You bet he does! He tol' me at noon today he wished he could find something that would help bring some money in. His mother's sick,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_16|"an' Jakey don' look so good himself."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_17|"Are you coming?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_18|"I'm coming. I'll ask for Jakey."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_19|"Betcha aren't goin' after all!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_20|"Aw -- you're stalling!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_21|"Not any sucha thing. I'm going now."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_22|"O.K. Let's see you."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_23|"You said you were coming with me!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_24|"Well, I was,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_25|"but I just remembered. My mother told me to bring her some stuff from the Safeway. I'll run all the way and come back and meet you."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_26|"Aw shucks!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_02_dawson_64kb_27|"I'll meetcha in fifteen or twenty minutes,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_0|"Be of good heart, Amos,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_1|"and look after young Christopher as best you can."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_2|"Yessir, I will!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_3|"All is well understood?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_4|"This is no time for misunderstandings!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_5|"Aye aye, sir! All is clear!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_6|"Then Godspeed to you all and bring you safely home,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_7|"Be on the lookout for this lad, Ned, when you get past the bar."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_8|"and good luck to the two of ye!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_9|"Come, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_10|"First, wind the rope about your waist, and once on board, bind it under your shirt. Let no one, not even Amos, know of it."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_11|"Here are some oddments of magic that may prove their usefulness,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_12|"Wear them about your neck.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_13|"What happens to the rope and pouch when I change my shape, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_14|"They will remain with you, have no fear of that,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_15|"What would be the use of magic if it proved unable to adjust itself?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_16|"So, all is ready,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_17|"Now we must be off and lose no time, for we have much ahead of us,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_18|"What I wouldn't give for a flashlight!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_19|"Yes, the twentieth century has many conveniences,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_20|"The anchor may have dragged,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_21|"Now for our boat!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_22|"I shall see that the men sleep soundly,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_23|"You do the rest."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_24|"I shall, sir!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_25|"Look sir -- the Mirabelle!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_26|"Then quick!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_27|"We took too long! It seems we are a trifle late!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_28|"is the place marked?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_29|"Hup! Oh dear! the hiccups!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_30|"Let me have more wine!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_31|"Mark it -- hic! -- Claggett. You may forget. All those -- hup! -- walls, to get over, or -- hic! under.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_32|"Oh dear! Hic! Think of those jewels, Claggett! Hup! Devil take these hiccups!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_33|"Claggett!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_34|"Are you asleep, or angry, or -- ? Hic! -- Put a cross where the Tree is, I say! I want those -- hup! -- jewels, Claggett, and so do you! Hic!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_35|"There!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_36|"will that shut you up?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_37|"I smell him!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_38|"He's here! Hullo! Night watchman!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_39|"Hm-mm. Hic! Jewels! Hup!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_40|"How shall it be, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_41|"Shall I become a beaver and go down and gnaw the rope off at the anchor?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_42|"It can be more easily done than that and nothing to trace it. Get in the boat. Here comes the Mirabelle."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_43|"Let me have my hand upon that rope!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_44|"Will she go where she should, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_45|"That she will, Christopher!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_46|"And we must get out of her way, for here she comes down at us. The wind and the tide and -- hm-m -- other forces will drive her solidly upon the bar. If I mistake not, it will be several days before they get her off,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_47|"Pull, boy!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_48|"Here she comes!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_49|"Quick, lad! Now we must catch the Mirabelle, and you and I must part."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_50|"Oh, sir!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_51|"I shall miss you too, my lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_52|"Now, let us send this boat over the river as fast as she can go. And bear in mind -- keep your own shape at all times unless you can change it out of sight of prying eyes.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_53|"Oh yes, I nearly forgot. Among the effects placed in your sea chest you will find a conch shell. Hold it to your ear, Christopher, as children do to hear the sea. You will be able to hear my voice, if ever you should need to."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_54|"Oh -- like a walkie-talkie?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_55|"What about getting you to shore, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_56|"Have you forgotten who I am, my boy?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_57|"No sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_58|"Then undo the dinghy and clamber up the side, for here we are,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_59|"I'll do my best, sir, but I hope you'll stay with me!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_60|"All that I can, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_18_dawson_64kb_61|"Godspeed!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_0|"Chris! Look at that procession going in the big gate! All those pigtailed gentlemen dressed in embroidered coats. I like that blue one with butterflies on it. No, I'd sooner have the black satin one with the dragon in red and yellow!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_1|"Or the one with the peacock in green and purple. Which would you sooner have?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_2|"I like their funny black hats and droopy mustaches. Why don't they look like us, Chris?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_3|"Who-all's in the curtained stretcher they're carrying?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_4|"It's a palanquin, Amos. They carry dignitaries in them."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_5|"Hate to be a dignitary in all this heat,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_6|"What are they doing now?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_7|"Wai! Wo!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_8|"Gee! Imagine the weight of those doors!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_9|"Golly Moses!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_10|"Take a look, Amos. Those gates are made of bronze, nearly three feet thick! And now they have the gates open, look at the depth of the walls. They're as deep through as a room!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_11|"Wai! Wo!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_12|"Lawsy me!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_13|"We don't know whether those folks got to the Emperor or not. Likely he's in behind a couple more walls, just to be on the safe side.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_14|"How are we going past all that many guards and trumpets, Chris? Even if we could tie up a guard or two, how in the world we going to push open gates that heavy?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_15|"Wonder what goes on?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_16|"Never heard a sweeter note,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_17|"Might be made of silver, 'way they sound."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_18|"Twelve gates!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_19|"And look, you were right, they are silver trumpets!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_28_dawson_64kb_20|"That color! Yellow is the royal color of China!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_0|"What-all comes next, and have we some more of those dates?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_1|"We have to wait until dusk anyway,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_2|"and by the look of the light that won't be long."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_3|"Strike 3."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_4|"Strike 3."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_5|"Strike three."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_6|"Now, if that isn't handy!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_7|"it's time for me to go. Are you awake?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_8|"I have a handy thing here which is for you to use only -- do you hear? only if I don't come back."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_9|"Don't come back? Law! Chris, don't you leave me in this heathen country where nobody understands good English!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_10|"Why, unless I'd steal, and Miss Becky told me never to do that -- but unless I did, how could I eat in these foreign parts?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_11|"Well, I don't know how you could, myself. But don't you cross any bridges until you come to them. Look.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_12|"If I'm not back by two sunups from now -- I may have to hide all during tomorrow -- if I'm not back by then, put this package out beyond the trees in the clearing. That's very important. You've got that?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_13|"I haven't got anything but a few old dried-up fruits,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_14|"No, Amos!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_15|"I mean, do you understand that much?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_16|"Oh yes, of course. Why didn't you say so in the first place? You said, put the package out in the clear. Where's that, on this tippy-top of a hill?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_17|"The ledge near where we climbed up. That's big enough,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_18|"Amos! Not now! I said only if you have to get away. If someone comes after you, or if I don't come back. Promise me not to strike three at all except for either of those two reasons."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_19|"what happens when I do hit three times?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_20|"Why, it's a mag -- it's a special kind of balloon,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_21|"A balloon. Oh."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_22|"No sir!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_23|"Me in the air over the roofs and high up? No indeedy, Chris! Not me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_24|"Look, Amos. If you have to use it, you'll be in such a bad fix that being up in the air will seem like the very best thing that could happen. Stop running. I'll be back -- I hope."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_25|"And now, wish me luck, and stay here and wait for me. Don't follow me now, or watch, or I might fail."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_26|"can't I go? You might get hurt. There's no telling what could happen if you're all alone!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_27|"Better not. But I'd sure like to, Amos. Now don't lose that package. It's your escape. Wish me luck."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_29_dawson_64kb_28|"Here, Chris. Our fruits. Better not to eat strange food in this foreigny place. Good luck,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_0|"Perhaps we had better sit down and I will try to make it understandable."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_1|"Let me put it this way,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_2|"You have a television set at home?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_3|"Yes, they are splendid, I know,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_4|"But will you please explain to me how television works?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_5|"Well golly Moses, Mr. Wicker,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_6|"it seems to be pretty complicated to go into."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_7|"Is it not? Very complicated. You probably would not be able to describe to me the details of how the radio or long-distance telephone work either, would you, young man?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_8|"No, sir, I guess not. We're just glad to be able to use them, I expect."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_9|"Ah!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_10|"that faculty is also still in the future. In the meantime it remains a rare gift."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_11|"You have it, Christopher. You were born with the ability to move backward into time that has passed. Whether or not you will ever master the gift of moving into the future, that, of course
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_12|"is impossible to tell. You may. But for my purposes, that you have been able to return this far is enough.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_13|"Have you understood what I have been saying up to now?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_14|"I think so, sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_15|"This ability to move back and forth in Time,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_16|"is no more farfetched than the ability to send colored images and sound across the land into your own house, where you can see and hear them. It is something which, so far, and I mean, of course, in your time, has not yet been discovered. But it will be,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_17|"Yes, it will be.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_18|"But until it has been it appears fantastic, does it not?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_19|"It certainly does!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_20|"If it weren't happening to me I wouldn't believe it!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_21|"and I would not blame you. But now,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_22|"you must have your mind set at rest regarding your mother.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_23|"They say too,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_24|"that crystal balls are the things to look into. Perfect tommyrot. This will do equally well. Look and see."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_25|"The turn has come. She will pull through, but she will need watchful care."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_26|"Oh, thank God! Thank God!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_27|"Is that a trick too?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_28|"Just to make me stay?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_29|"No, son,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_07_dawson_64kb_30|"That is how it really is. My word of honor."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_0|"Should the wind keep up as it is now, by nightfall or by dawn at the latest, we should sight Tahiti. We've water and fresh stores to take on there.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_1|"'Tis a fair place, is Tahiti, and one you lads will have an interest and a pleasure in seeing."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_2|"Nearly to Tahiti, eh, my lad?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_3|"Is all this clear?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_4|"Certainly my boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_5|"Mr. Finney will be some time on deck. We cannot be overheard in here."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_6|"How now, lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_7|"how are you to find the channel in the dark?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_8|"I -- I see uncommonly well by night, Captain sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_9|"and I'm a very strong swimmer."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_10|"You can understand I do not fancy it. However,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_11|"I take orders from Mr. Wicker, the owner of the Mirabelle, and since he says so, this is how it must be."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_12|"He told me you would have information from him for me, from time to time. We shall say no more, but I trust you understand the responsibility you have? This ship, its cargo, and its men will be in your hands."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_13|"Yes sir. I think I can do it safely, or I should not try, sir."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_14|"Aye, aye. No doubt. Just bear it in mind at the time, eh lad?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_15|"After we see -- whatever we are to see,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_16|"I'll be absent for a while. What can be said during that time, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_17|"I shall say you have a tropical fever, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_18|"I am somewhat skilled in medicaments -- I have to be, as captain of a ship, and the crew know it. I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you. I shall allow no one to enter it but myself. It will be a most contagious fever for a time,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_19|"I shall bring you food with my own hands. Nothing much -- broth and gruel, and I daresay I can eat it myself if I cannot throw it out the porthole!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_20|"Have no fear on that score, Christopher.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_21|"You have your part to carry out, I have mine."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_22|"Oh sir!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_23|"Mr. Wicker said we'd know the reason why we must take shelter tomorrow at sundown today. And now it is sundown!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_21_dawson_64kb_24|"Run down to your cabin and fetch up that good spyglass of yours, my boy. We shall have a good look, for as you know, night falls in a few moments after sundown in these waters."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_0|"No, my boy. The church is not yet built. That will come in seventy years. In eighteen-sixty, to be exact. Confusing, is it not?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_1|"Good morning, my boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_2|"I trust you slept well?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_3|"Oh yes, thank you sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_4|"I don't even know how I got to bed."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_5|"And breakfast?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_6|"Becky fed you?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_7|"Yes sir. And Mr. Cilley -- he fed me too."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_8|"Indeed?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_9|"Ned Cilley so early? Well, he is a loyal soul, is Cilley. You shall know more of him."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_10|"Feel? Well -- all right, I guess, in a way. But there's a sort of spinning in my head and my stomach if I try to figure any of this out. I just don't get it.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_11|"If I can just go now, please?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_12|"Sit down, Christopher my lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_13|"We have much to talk of, you and I. But first, your mind and heart shall be put at ease. Do you know who I am?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_14|"You sell old stuff. That's all I know,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_15|"I sell old things -- in your time. But now -- in this time, what do you know of me?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_16|"I am a shipowner, Christopher, for one thing,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_17|"I am also quite a fine magician,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_18|"Rabbits out of hats?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_19|"No, young man,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_20|"Not rabbits out of hats. That -- as you would say -- is for toddlers. Suppose I prove to you just how good?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_21|"Watch closely then,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_22|"I have been in my twentieth-century shape so that you would recognize me. Now I shall regain my appearance of this time -- not a great change, I grant you, but there will be a difference. Watch me closely."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_23|"I don't believe it!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_24|"Fascinating, is it not?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_25|"A good trick, do you not agree?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_26|"Well yes,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_27|"Ah,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_28|"Ah. Then we shall try another. See if you can find me.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_29|"You're not here,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_30|"Oh, yes, I am,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_31|"Look on the table."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_32|"It's not fair!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_33|"You've got some trick hiding place. You're just not here."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_34|"Yes I am,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_35|"I am within reach of your hand, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_36|"And I will reappear in whatever part of the room you wish. Choose."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_37|"by the window. There's nothing anywhere around it. Come back there."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_06_dawson_64kb_38|"Darn that ol' fly!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_0|"most certainly sir. I have the chocolate hot, as it so happens, and some cakes new-baked."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_1|"we shall refresh ourselves and you shall listen, if you will."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_2|"I told you,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_3|"Destruction is so fast, and to construct and build,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_4|"that is what is slow.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_5|"You will help your country get its start?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_6|"Oh, yes sir! You bet! If I can, I'll help!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_7|"It had to be, for it could be no other way. But there is always doubt. Your hand, my boy, for we have work to do together."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_8|"Listen closely,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_9|"There is a wondrous thing, unique in the world, and which, for the benefit of this growing country, we must obtain. Its possession will mean we can pay for many things -- a new city here, tools; building materials. This wonderful object is the Jewel Tree belonging to the Princess of China."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_10|"This Jewel Tree,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_11|"is a tree that grows, that puts out leaves and flowers and bears fruit, but here is the wonder of it,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_12|"This growing tree is made of jewels; leaves and flowers and even seeded fruit. The leaves are emeralds; the flowers, diamonds and sapphires; the fruits, huge rubies seeded thick with pearls. Imagine such a treasure if you can!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_13|"Imagine the possession of such a plant!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_14|"Break off a branch of it -- another grows. And flowers and fruit -- much like your orange trees -- bear both their fruit and flowers at the same time."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_15|"The taking of such a prize would be hard enough,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_16|"for it is well guarded. But there is a greater hazard.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_17|"There is a man here, posing as a merchant. Claggett Chew. You will see him in the town when you walk there, which you shall do, presently. But he has some magic powers, and knows me well. Too well.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_18|"We have been enemies for long,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_19|"but he has yet to get the better of me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_20|"Is he after the Jewel Tree too?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_21|"He is. He heard of it, by power of magic certainly, for it is a secret so well guarded that those who carry knowledge of it -- all but myself, up to this time -- all others have died before they could make use of it. You can well imagine,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_22|"that a treasure that replenishes itself is beyond price. The Chinese Emperor knows it well. So do the guards about his palaces, and so does Claggett Chew."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_23|"There is one way,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_24|"and that is where I need your help.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_25|"then only would we have an opportunity to seize the Jewel Tree. Can you learn what I know?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_26|"Can you learn my magic?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_27|"Those tricks -- the fly -- and others?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_28|"I got here, didn't I? I've gone back all these years, so I guess I could.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_29|"At least I can try,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_30|"I know that you can learn. For you it will not be hard."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_31|"There's just one thing,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_32|"You say, sir, 'Seize the Tree.' That means just stealing it? Must we do that?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_33|"You are the lad for me!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_08_dawson_64kb_34|"I knew it from the first! It would be stealing, boy, but for one thing. When -- and heaven willing, if -- you reach the Tree, you will break a branch from it and stick it in the ground. It will root itself and grow and thrive, and the Princess will still have delicate jewel flowers for her hair."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_0|"Oh, Lordy, Lordy!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_1|"what did I tell you, lads?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_2|"That be the Black Vulture, the pirate ship. No vessel is safe near the Black Vulture! What a God's mercy that all of us, and the Mirabelle, are out of sight, for the men aboard the Vulture know no pity, lads!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_3|"Ned, don't most ships just paint the name on the side?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_4|"Aye lad, that they do,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_5|"Then isn't it unusual to have letters carved of wood and gilded, on the side of a ship?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_6|"Aye, that it be.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_7|"What're ye aimin' at now, me lad, eh?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_8|"What's in your mind?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_9|"Just tell me what ships you know whose name is not painted on but set in carved letters, Ned,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_10|"Let me see, now. There's the Southerner -- no, that's painted on, or the Priscilla Drew -- no; that's painted too.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_11|"Come, boys, what ship has carved letters for her name, not painted ones? Where's a better memory nor mine?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_12|"There's only one ship that ever I did see with carven letters on her side, and that was Chew's ship, the Venture."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_13|"Aye aye!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_14|"Look then, for there's your same ship! The Venture and the Vulture are one and the same! Here -- take my glass,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_15|"And his friend with the airs!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_16|"Have we then been harboring the like of him at home?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_17|"Aye -- to let him go free to scuttle the next fine ship, take all her cargo, and leave her valiant men to drown!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_18|"How-now, men, be still! We are here to see what may take place, but if your voices should carry, as well they may, over the water, we should have little chance of it. Do you be still and watchful."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_19|"Look! Around the point! Here comes another ship -- looks like that was what the ol' blackbird was a-waiting for!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_20|"Bless my cap and buttons!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_21|"there's to be a fight for sartin. I can see the flash of light on the swords and axes!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_22|"Come, lads,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_23|"We have seen what we had to see, and many is the witness now against Claggett Chew and all his company!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_24|"Aye! Aye! That we are! We'll bear witness to such villainy -- they should all hang for it!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_25|"Then let us go back to our own ship, for the dreaded Vulture is not yet gone, and unarmed as we too are, what chance have we against cannon balls and armed men?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_26|"'tis my advice you had best return with us now, or you might be missed by one or another of the men, and they have much time to think. You shall do what has been set for you to do -- we shall stay here another day to take on water and fresh fruits."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_27|"It will not be a moment too soon for me until I see you safe and sound on board again, my lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_24_dawson_64kb_28|"for I like you well and would have no smallest harm come to you."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_0|"It is enough for a while,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_1|"that Amos get used to being limber and alive. That is change enough from a carved wooden figure. It would only confuse and trouble him to think you do not really belong where you are. So let him be happy. And I shall seal your lips with regard to the secret of the Jewel Tree, for that must be known to no one,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_2|"Now tell me what you are to journey after,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_3|"Not even to me. Excellent stuff, this,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_4|"I got it in India years ago, and this is the last of it. But I hardly imagine I shall need it again. Its use is somewhat drastic, but occasionally wise."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_5|"of the three things in your shop window that I liked best, two have been explained. Yet the third, which still interests me, seems to have had, so far, no significance. I mean, of course, the rope."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_6|"Ah yes,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_7|"the rope. Very well, my boy, since it has come into your mind again, that means that the time has come for you to discover its use. Go and bring it to me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_8|"You have heard of the Indian rope trick, Christopher?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_9|"Yes -- and no, sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_10|"I'm not sure how it works."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_11|"Indeed? Well, let me tell you, my boy, no one else does either. The rope is made to go up in the air, so stiffly that the fakir -- that is, the Eastern magician -- can climb it. Some claim to have seen the fakirs climb up it and vanish from sight, and the rope disappear after them."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_12|"A good enough trick, in its way,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_13|"but this rope is capable of so much more remarkable possibilities as to throw the Indian rope trick completely in the shade."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_14|"that, too, you shall learn, but how to use this particular rope to make the most of its -- shall we say? -- qualities."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_15|"Now Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_16|"just push that table and the chairs to the wall, there's a good lad, and we shall get the stiffness out of this rope.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_17|"And pull the curtains, my boy,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_18|"for one never knows but that Amos or Becky Boozer might pass by at the crucial moment. What they do not know,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_19|"Now Christopher, your attention please,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_20|"Imagine that you are in need of a boat, and there is no boat."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_21|"Go and feel of it, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_22|"Climb in it if you like. I have left the two ends of the rope long enough to make oars, if necessary."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_23|"Gee! Mr. Wicker!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_24|"This is the best yet -- except for Amos. Golly Moses!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_25|"Even oars!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_26|"Quite so. Now climb out and I will show you some of the other shapes of which it is capable. A ladder,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_27|"is almost too simple. We can do that at any time."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_28|"It will have to be a small elephant,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_11_dawson_64kb_29|"because of the size of the room."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_0|"Mistress Boozer,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_1|"Quite so -- you did perfectly right,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_2|"Indeed? I did not see that too clearly, and so I was not sure.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_3|"Go have your supper lad, and come back. I have some other things to say."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_4|"Ah now, Master Cilley,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_5|"you will fade away into a wraith, my good man, so you will! Do you not eat a morsel nor a mouthful, and die in the night, how shall I bear to live with my conscience thereafter, tell me that?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_6|"Eh, lack-a-day!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_7|"The life of a sailor, 'tis that hard -- is't not, me boys?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_8|"Or else, me innards is ruint by that galley cook of ours.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_9|"Ah, sweet Boozer, were you to sample but a spoonful of what us pore sailors must face week after week, and month after month, and us on the high seas -- you bein' such a delikit cook, so to speak -- your heart's blood would curdle on the instant, that it would, by my cap and buttons!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_10|"Deary me, the saints preserve and defend us!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_11|"I must do all in my poor weak woman's power to tempt you as best I may. Draw up, lads, for here it comes!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_12|"Mr. Wicker asked me to see him for a moment.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_13|"That was a superb supper, Becky. I'm stuffed."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_14|"Why -- a mere mouthful, a taste, a tidbit, was all any of you had. See -- there's a pigeon or two left, and half a duck, and part of the beef pie -- why, you do but peck at your food, all of you, like poor birds!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_15|"Anyhow, thanks again. I'll be back,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_16|"Do you not recognise these things, Christopher?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_17|"Well -- it seems to me I may have seen them before -- they sort of look familiar, but -- I couldn't be sure."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_18|"They are your twentieth-century clothes, my lad. The ones you wear in your own time. And deeply as it hurts me to say it, the moment has come for you to put them on."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_19|"Not yet? I don't have to go now, do I, sir?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_20|"And -- and -- I didn't say good-bye to Captain Blizzard or Mr. Finney. They were wonderful to me, really they were! And
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_21|"Does it have to be?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_22|"It has to be,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_23|"I am afraid I shall have to have the leather pouch, Christopher,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_24|"More than that,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_25|"I shall have to take everything from you that you have gained here, Christopher.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_26|"All but one thing which you may choose and keep -- one ability.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_27|"I'd like to be able to come back, sir,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_28|"So you shall, Christopher, so you shall! And you shall remember it all, I promise you. That too, you can have."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_35_dawson_64kb_29|"good soldier that you are for General Washington and for your country, all that you learned must leave you and remain with me."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_0|"First and foremost,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_1|"You had best know who I am.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_2|"I am a member of the Mirabelle's crew!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_3|"The Mirabelle!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_4|"Why -- that's the ship in the bottle!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_5|"The model of it's in a bottle right enough, since it's meself that made it, the last trip home from the Chiny Seas."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_6|"You made it yourself?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_7|"How in the world could you get it inside?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_8|"Ah, 'tis a trick and a tedious thing, no mistaking, but there's time and to spare for it, coming home from China."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_9|"China? You've been there? What's it like?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_10|"That's a tale for another time, my boy, for there's much telling there. You wanted the story of Becky's fine hat."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_11|"Yes -- yes!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_12|"Bein' a member of the Mirabelle and all, means I see quite a bit of this port when we're home.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_13|"An' seein' as how Mistress Becky and me are fast friends, well -- she's told me a thing or two that not everyone knows."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_14|"now a hat of that sort costs many a shilling, and Becky worked and saved for that bonnet for over a year.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_15|"If you tell what I tell ye, Chris lad,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_16|"I shall get even with ye, I swear I will! For I would never want to hurt the feelin's of Becky Boozer, on my oath."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_17|"I'll not tell, sir. Not to anyone,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_18|"Well now,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_19|"It seems at long last she paid for that bonnet, and decided to wear it to the spectacle, that very afternoon."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_20|"The spectacle?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_21|"What's that?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_22|"Haw -- Haw!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_23|"You are a country boy! Why -- the spectacle, where the players are. The theatre -- what else?"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_24|"Now as you seem not acquainted with the theatre, me lad, let me tell you that we give it here in any hall standing vacant, and out of doors in fair weather, and we set the benches in rows for those that pay for seats."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_25|"Well, did she take it off?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_26|"'Twas asked with rare politeness, anyone would agree to that.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_27|"The poor gentleman says again,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_28|"And would you believe it, my lad -- no.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_29|"No, no, you would not.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_30|"Mistress Rebecca Boozer was that proud -- that proud
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_31|"that not for the world would she remove her bonnet. Dear me no! She tossed her head again, feeling all them plumes a-tossin' too, and sat up straighter than before. An' she a tall woman."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_32|"Well, little did she dream, our Becky Boozer. For when she tossed her head the second time and made no motion to remove her hat, the gentleman bent toward her, and -- no doubt, his words were for her alone. And this is what he said."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_33|"And do you know,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_34|"I have. You'll not be able to heave it off, that I promise you. That hat is there for good and all. Mistress Boozer will doubtless be buried in that bonnet.
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_35|"And what do you think of that?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_36|"Master Cilley,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_37|"Does she -- does she sleep in it?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_38|"Be off with you, boy!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_39|"You and Cilley -- you're two of a kind, that is plain to be seen!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_40|"Get along with you!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_41|"You are wanted by the master in his study, so look sharp! It's down the passage and to your right,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_05_dawson_64kb_42|"and knock before you go in!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_0|"Let's climb up a little above them,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_1|"We're beyond the bridge -- they might be -- well, we'd better be careful. I want to see what they're doing before they see us."
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_2|"Come now, Gosler!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_3|"Pay up -- you've lost!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_4|"I've no money to pay you,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_5|"I'm a poor man -- well you know it. A cripple -- just a poor old cripple!"
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_6|"Ah -- none o' that!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_7|"We know how well you do at your begging -- more in a day than we get in a month's pay. Pay up now, or it won't go well with you,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_8|"What about your glass, your spyglass, Gosler?
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_9|"Put that up and it will cover your losses well enough!
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_10|"No, no, good fellows,
4062.mrwhickerswindow_15_dawson_64kb_11|"not my glass. I won that from the Captain himself three years ago, and that I never shall part from willingly."

3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_53|“This is too much! How is this?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_54|“What are they? Speak.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_55|“This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is Jean Valjean himself who was M. Madeleine.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_56|“What tale are you telling me?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_57|“And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the person who killed Javert was Javert.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_58|“What do you mean to say?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_59|“That Javert committed suicide.”

3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_62|“I have my papers,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_63|“Two facts, two proofs,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_64|“Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of that fortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of a whole countryside! he is Jean Valjean, Javert’s savior! he is a hero! he is a saint!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_65|“He’s not a saint, and he’s not a hero!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_66|“He’s an assassin and a robber.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_67|“Let us be calm.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_68|“Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine, but he is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_69|“of that miserable theft, committed forty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a whole life of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_70|“I might interrupt you at this point,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_71|“It cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_72|“Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the day of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the point where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides and the Pont de Jéna.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_73|“Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by Jean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_74|“The young man was myself, and here is the coat!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_75|“I’m struck all of a heap.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_76|“Ah! Jondrette Thénardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson, you dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager of the shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here! Waterloo protects you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_77|“Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_78|“Monsieur le Baron!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_79|“eternal gratitude.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_80|“Cosette! Cosette!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_81|“Come! come quick! Let us go. Basque, a carriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let us not lose a minute! Put on your shawl.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_82|“Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_83|“Rue de l’Homme Armé, Number 7.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_84|“Ah! what happiness!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_41_hugo_64kb_85|“Rue de l’Homme Armé, I did not dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_0|“Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_1|“It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_2|“And you also, you pardon me!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_3|“It embarrasses me,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_4|“‘You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, things will not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of an angel.’ And the angel comes, and one sees one’s Cosette again! and one sees one’s little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_5|“So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_6|“Why tell all that?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_7|“why did you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save people’s lives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext of unmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_8|“I told the truth,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_9|“the truth is the whole truth; and that you did not tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved Javert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said so?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_10|“Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It was necessary that I should go away. If you had known about that affair, of the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was therefore forced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have caused embarrassment in every way.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_11|“It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_12|“I shall not be here, but I shall not be with you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_13|“Ah! come now, we are not going to permit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong to us. We shall not loose our hold of you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_14|“This time it is for good,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_15|“We have a carriage at the door. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_16|“Your chamber still stands ready in our house,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_17|“The proof that God is good is that she is here.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_18|“It is a pity.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_19|“your hands are still colder than before. Are you ill? Do you suffer?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_20|“I? No,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_21|“I am very well. Only . . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_22|“I am going to die presently.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_23|“Yes, but that is nothing,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_24|“Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breast is dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_25|“Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist upon your living, do you hear?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_26|“Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was on the verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that I was born again.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_27|“You are full of strength and life,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_28|“that Marius says that you shall not die.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_29|“Good-day, and farewell, doctor,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_30|“Here are my poor children.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_31|“Because things are not agreeable,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_32|“that is no reason for being unjust towards God.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_33|“Ah! it was you that he wanted!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_34|“It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_35|“Behold the great martyr.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_36|“Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_37|“He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_38|“You are good, both of you,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_39|“Would you like a priest?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_42_hugo_64kb_40|“I have had one,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_0|“Dame, sir,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_1|“we all woke up late.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_2|“Is your master up?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_3|“How is Monsieur’s arm?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_4|“Better. Is your master up?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_5|“Which one? the old one or the new one?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_6|“Monsieur Pontmercy.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_7|“Monsieur le Baron,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_8|“My son will bear my title.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_9|“Monsieur le Baron?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_10|“I will go and see. I will tell him that M. Fauchelevent is here.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_11|“No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to speak to him in private, and mention no name.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_12|“I wish to surprise him.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_13|“It is you, father!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_14|“that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come too early. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_15|“How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday! Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_16|“I have something to say to you. I am an ex-convict.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_17|“I am an ex-convict,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_18|“There is nothing the matter with my hand,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_19|“There has not been anything the matter with it,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_20|“What is the meaning of this?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_21|“The meaning of it is,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_22|“that I have been in the galleys.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_23|“You are driving me mad!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_24|“Monsieur Pontmercy,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_25|“I was nineteen years in the galleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a second offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_26|“Say all, say all!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_27|“You are Cosette’s father!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_28|“It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oath to others may not be received in law . . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_29|“Who will prove that to me?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_30|“I. Since I tell you so.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_31|“do you tell me all this? Who forces you to do so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither denounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In what connection do you make this confession? What is your motive?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_32|“Do you see that fist?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_33|“In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, in order to live, I will not steal a name.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_34|“You do not need that name in order to live?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_35|“Ah! I understand the matter,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_36|“While, at present, I am relieved.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_37|“I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_38|“What do you say to that?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_39|“My grandfather has friends,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_40|“I will procure your pardon.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_41|“It is useless,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_42|“I am believed to be dead, and that suffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are supposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_43|“Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty; and I need but one pardon, that of my conscience.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_44|“I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, instead of being with me!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_45|“I have caught you in the very act,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_46|“Just now, I heard my father Fauchelevent through the door saying: ‘Conscience . . . doing my duty . . .’ That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. People should not talk politics the very next day. It is not right.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_47|“You are mistaken. Cosette,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_48|“we are talking business. We are discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs . . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_49|“That is not it at all,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_50|“I am coming. Does anybody want me here?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_51|“There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_52|“I am going to install myself near you in an easy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything you like, I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_53|“We are talking business.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_54|“I have opened my window, a flock of pierrots has arrived in the garden, — Birds, not maskers. To-day is Ash-Wednesday; but not for the birds.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_55|“I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave us alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_56|“You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are very dandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_57|“I assure you that it will bore you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_58|“No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen to you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not need to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here together — that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_59|“You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_60|“Impossible!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_61|“I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_62|“Well, am I anybody?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_63|“In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? who gave me such a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is very unhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_64|“As for you, I shall make a face at you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_65|“Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_66|“Did you sleep badly?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_67|“Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, I will not scold you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_68|“Now, defend me against my husband.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_69|“Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk before me. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! business, placing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out of nothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_70|“I adore you!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_71|“I shall stay.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_72|“No, not that,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_73|“We have to finish something.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_74|“Still no?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_75|“I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_76|“I am very angry indeed.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_77|“when she finds out . . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_78|“Oh! would that I could die!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_79|“Be at your ease,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_80|“I will keep your secret for myself alone.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_81|“I thank you, sir,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_82|“All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_83|“Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I ought not to see Cosette any more?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_84|“I think that would be better,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_85|“I shall never see her more,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_86|“You shall come every evening,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_87|“and Cosette will be waiting for you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_36_hugo_64kb_88|“You are kind, sir,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_0|“You will watch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_1|“Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_2|“I will remain below,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_3|“I will go and inform Madame.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_4|“I will remain below,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_5|“father, I knew that you were peculiar, but I never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that you wish me to receive you here.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_6|“Yes, it is my wish.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_7|“I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_8|“You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind, I pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_9|“This is becoming serious,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_10|“What have I done to you? I declare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine with us.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_11|“That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to the drawing-room. Immediately.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_12|“But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me. It’s horrible here.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_13|“You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.”

3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_15|“You wished to be Madame. You are so.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_16|“Not for you, father.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_17|“Do not call me father.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_18|“Call me ‘Monsieur Jean.’ ‘Jean,’ if you like.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_19|“You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? ‘Monsieur Jean’? What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren’t they? what has taken place? come, look me in the face. And you won’t live with us! And you won’t have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anything happened?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_20|“Everything is as usual.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_21|“Why do you change your name?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_22|“You have changed yours, surely.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_23|“Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_24|“This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living here, — there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet, — living with us, quitting that hole of a Rue de l’Homme Armé, not giving us riddles to guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfasting with us, being my father.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_25|“You no longer need a father, you have a husband.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_26|“I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to things like that, which are not common sense!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_27|“If Toussaint were here,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_28|“she would be the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my own. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_29|“Just now, as I was coming hither,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_30|“Hou! the villainous bear!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_31|“I am furious,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_32|“Are you angry with me because I am happy?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_33|“Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal. Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_34|“Ah, you have said thou to me!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_35|“Thanks, father!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_36|“I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_37|“I have said thou to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happen again. Pardon me.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_38|“Monsieur Jean.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_39|“Monsieur has always been like that,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_40|“He’s an original.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_41|“Nothing is more common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer things. They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are fantastic appearances that people affect.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_42|“Monsieur Jean,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_43|“You used to be my father, you are no longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you were Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don’t like all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of you.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_38_hugo_64kb_44|“Monsieur Jean.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_0|“We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_1|“Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet returned,

3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_3|“In what way did you go thither?
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_4|“And how did you return?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_5|“In a hackney carriage.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_6|“Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupé would only cost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_7|“It is like Toussaint,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_8|“She is gone. You have not replaced her. Why?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_9|“Nicolette suffices.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_10|“But you ought to have a maid.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_11|“Have I not Marius?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_12|“You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, a box at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit by your riches? Wealth adds to happiness.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_13|“M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_14|“It is perfectly simple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_15|“Heavens! how cold it is here!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_16|“Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_17|“Yes, since we are now in the month of May.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_18|“But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in this cellar.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_19|“I thought that a fire was unnecessary.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_20|“That is exactly like one of your ideas!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_21|“My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_22|“Ah, what’s this!
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_23|“no chairs! Where are the armchairs?”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_24|“They are no longer here,
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_25|“This is too much!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_26|“It was I who told Basque to remove them.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_27|“I have only a few minutes to stay to-day.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_28|“A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_29|“I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_30|“You have company this evening, no doubt.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_31|“We expect no one.”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_32|“To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out. How odd you are!”
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_33|“Adieu, Cosette.
3762.lesmiserables_vol5_39_hugo_64kb_34|“Adieu, Madame.”

665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_4|“What about my companions, captain?”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_5|“They’ve been alerted and are waiting for us.”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_6|“Aren’t we going to put on our diving suits?

665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_8|“Here we are, Professor Aronnax,
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_9|“Our lighting equipment would be useless to us,
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_10|“We won’t be going very deep, and the sun’s rays will be sufficient to light our way. Besides, it’s unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves. Their brightness might unexpectedly attract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways.”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_11|“What about our weapons?
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_12|“Our rifles?”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_13|“Rifles! What for? Don’t your mountaineers attack bears dagger in hand? And isn’t steel surer than lead? Here’s a sturdy blade. Slip it under your belt and let’s be off.”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_14|“Thank you, Mr. Land,
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_15|“Tit for tat, captain,
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_16|“I owed it to you.”
665.20000leaguesundertheseas_2-03_verne_64kb_17|“To the Nautilus,
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_0|“You’re going to the water, Miss? — you think she’s in — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_1|“She may be, though the depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But what I judge most likely is that she’s on the spot from which, the other day, we saw together what I told you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_2|“When she pretended not to see — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_3|“With that astounding self-possession? I’ve always been sure she wanted to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_4|“You suppose they really talk of them?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_5|“I could meet this with a confidence! They say things that, if we heard them, would simply appall us.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_6|“Then Miss Jessel is?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_7|“Beyond a doubt. You shall see.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_8|“Oh, thank you!
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_9|“No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_10|“Then where is it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_11|“Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go over, and then has managed to hide it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_12|“All alone — that child?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_13|“She’s not alone, and at such times she’s not a child: she’s an old, old woman.
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_14|“But if the boat’s there, where on earth’s she?
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_15|“That’s exactly what we must learn.
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_16|“By going all the way round?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_17|“Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it’s far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight over.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_18|“I’ll be hanged,
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_19|“if I’ll speak!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_20|“Why, where are your things?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_21|“Where yours are, my dear!
431.turn_of_the_screw_19_james_64kb_22|“And where’s Miles?
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_0|“Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them — so long as they were there — of course I promised. But what had happened to you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_1|“I only went with you for the walk,
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_2|“I had then to come back to meet a friend.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_3|“A friend — you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_4|“Oh, yes, I have a couple!
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_5|“But did the children give you a reason?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_6|“For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it better. Do you like it better?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_7|“No, I like it worse!
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_8|“Did they say why I should like it better?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_9|“No; Master Miles only said, ‘We must do nothing but what she likes!’”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_10|“I wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_11|“Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, ‘Oh, of course, of course!’ — and I said the same.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_12|“You were too sweet, too — I can hear you all. But nonetheless, between Miles and me, it’s now all out.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_13|“But what, miss?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_14|“Everything. It doesn’t matter. I’ve made up my mind. I came home, my dear,
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_15|“for a talk with Miss Jessel.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_16|“A talk! Do you mean she spoke?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_17|“It came to that. I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_18|“And what did she say?
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_19|“That she suffers the torments — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_20|“To share them — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_21|“She wants Flora.
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_22|“As I’ve told you, however, it doesn’t matter.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_23|“Because you’ve made up your mind? But to what?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_24|“To everything.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_25|“And what do you call ‘everything’?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_26|“Why, sending for their uncle.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_27|“Oh, miss, in pity do,
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_28|“Well, there’s that awful reason.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_29|“But — a — which?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_30|“Why, the letter from his old place.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_31|“You’ll show it to the master?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_32|“I ought to have done so on the instant.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_33|“Oh, no!
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_34|“I’ll put it before him,
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_35|“For we’ve never in the least known what!
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_36|“it’s their uncle’s fault. If he left here such people — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_37|“He didn’t really in the least know them. The fault’s mine.
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_38|“Well, you shan’t suffer,
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_39|“The children shan’t!
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_40|“Then what am I to tell him?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_41|“You needn’t tell him anything. I’ll tell him.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_42|“Do you mean you’ll write — ?
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_43|“How do you communicate?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_44|“I tell the bailiff. He writes.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_45|“And should you like him to write our story?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_46|“Ah, miss, you write!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_16_james_64kb_47|“Well — tonight,
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_0|“It all lies in half a dozen words,
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_1|“words that really settle the matter. ‘Think, you know, what I might do!’ He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows down to the ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he gave them a taste of at school.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_2|“Lord, you do change!
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_3|“they’re talking of them — they’re talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it’s a wonder I’m not. What I’ve seen would have made you so; but it has only made me more lucid, made me get hold of still other things.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_4|“Of what other things have you got hold?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_5|“it’s a policy and a fraud!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_6|“On the part of little darlings — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_7|“As yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_8|“They haven’t been good — they’ve only been absent. It has been easy to live with them, because they’re simply leading a life of their own. They’re not mine — they’re not ours. They’re his and they’re hers!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_9|“Quint’s and that woman’s?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_10|“Quint’s and that woman’s. They want to get to them.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_11|“But for what?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_12|“For the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put into them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work of demons, is what brings the others back.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_13|“They were rascals! But what can they now do?
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_14|“Don’t they do enough?
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_15|“They can destroy them!
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_16|“For the children to come?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_17|“And perish in the attempt!
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_18|“Unless, of course, we can prevent!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_19|“Their uncle must do the preventing. He must take them away.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_20|“And who’s to make him?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_21|“You, miss.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_22|“By writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and niece mad?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_23|“But if they are, miss?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_24|“And if I am myself, you mean? That’s charming news to be sent him by a governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_25|“Why those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his indifference must have been awful. As I’m not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn’t take him in.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_26|“Make him at any rate come to you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_27|“He ought to be here — he ought to help.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_12_james_64kb_28|“You see me asking him for a visit?
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_0|“She persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_1|“Ah, miss, it isn’t a matter on which I can push her! Yet it isn’t either, I must say, as if I much needed to. It has made her, every inch of her, quite old.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_2|“I think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a grand manner about it!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_3|“And that manner
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_4|“is practically what’s the matter with her now!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_5|“She asks me every three minutes if I think you’re coming in.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_6|“I see — I see.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_7|“Has she said to you since yesterday — except to repudiate her familiarity with anything so dreadful — a single other word about Miss Jessel?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_8|“Not one, miss. And of course you know,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_9|“I took it from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there was nobody.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_10|“Rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_11|“I don’t contradict her. What else can I do?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_12|“Yes, miss; but to what end?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_13|“Why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. She’ll make me out to him the lowest creature — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_14|“And him who thinks so well of you!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_15|“He has an odd way — it comes over me now,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_16|“Never again to so much as look at you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_17|“So that what you’ve come to me now for,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_18|“is to speed me on my way?
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_19|“I’ve a better idea — the result of my reflections. My going would seem the right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won’t do. It’s you who must go. You must take Flora.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_20|“But where in the world — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_21|“Away from here. Away from them. Away, even most of all, now, from me. Straight to her uncle.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_22|“Only to tell on you — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_23|“No, not ‘only’! To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_24|“And what is your remedy?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_25|“Your loyalty, to begin with. And then Miles’s.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_26|“Do you think he — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_27|“Won’t, if he has the chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think it. At all events, I want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me with him alone.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_28|“There’s one thing, of course,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_29|“they mustn’t, before she goes, see each other for three seconds.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_30|“that they have met?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_31|“Ah, miss, I’m not such a fool as that! If I’ve been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has been each time with one of the maids, and at present, though she’s alone, she’s locked in safe. And yet — and yet!
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_32|“And yet what?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_33|“Well, are you so sure of the little gentleman?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_34|“And did it come?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_35|“No, though I waited and waited, I confess it didn’t, and it was without a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sister’s condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night. All the same,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_36|“I can’t, if her uncle sees her, consent to his seeing her brother without my having given the boy — and most of all because things have got so bad — a little more time.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_37|“What do you mean by more time?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_38|“Unless, indeed,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_39|“you really want not to go.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_40|“I’ll go — I’ll go. I’ll go this morning.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_41|“If you should wish still to wait, I would engage she shouldn’t see me.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_42|“No, no: it’s the place itself. She must leave it.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_43|“I can’t stay.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_44|“You mean that, since yesterday, you have seen — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_45|“I’ve heard — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_46|“From that child — horrors! There!
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_47|“On my honor, miss, she says things — !
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_48|“Oh, thank God!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_49|“‘Thank God’?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_50|“It so justifies me!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_51|“It does that, miss!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_52|“She’s so horrible?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_53|“Really shocking.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_54|“And about me?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_55|“The appalling language she applied to me? I can, then!
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_56|“Well, perhaps I ought to also — since I’ve heard some of it before! Yet I can’t bear it,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_57|“But I must go back.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_58|“Ah, if you can’t bear it — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_59|“How can I stop with her, you mean? Why, just for that: to get her away. Far from this,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_60|“She may be different? She may be free?
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_61|“In such doings?
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_62|“I believe.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_63|“There’s one thing, of course — it occurs to me — to remember. My letter, giving the alarm, will have reached town before you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_64|“Your letter won’t have got there. Your letter never went.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_65|“What then became of it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_66|“Do you mean he took it?
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_67|“I mean that I saw yesterday, when I came back with Miss Flora, that it wasn’t where you had put it. Later in the evening I had the chance to question Luke, and he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_68|“Yes, I see that if Miles took it instead he probably will have read it and destroyed it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_69|“And don’t you see anything else?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_70|“It strikes me that by this time your eyes are open even wider than mine.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_71|“I make out now what he must have done at school.
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_72|“He stole!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_73|“Well — perhaps.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_74|“He stole letters!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_75|“I hope then it was to more purpose than in this case! The note, at any rate, that I put on the table yesterday,
431.turn_of_the_screw_21_james_64kb_76|“will have given him so scant an advantage — for it contained only the bare demand for an interview — that he is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that what he had on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_0|“Have you written, miss?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_1|“Yes — I’ve written.
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_2|“Why, my dear, how do I know?
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_3|“She’ll be above,
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_4|“in one of the rooms you haven’t searched.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_5|“No; she’s at a distance.
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_6|“She has gone out.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_7|“Isn’t that woman always without one?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_8|“She’s with her?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_9|“She’s with her!
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_10|“We must find them.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_11|“And where’s Master Miles?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_12|“Oh, he’s with Quint. They’re in the schoolroom.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_13|“The trick’s played,
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_14|“they’ve successfully worked their plan. He found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she went off.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_15|“Infernal, then!
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_16|“He has provided for himself as well. But come!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_17|“You leave him — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_18|“So long with Quint? Yes — I don’t mind that now.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_19|“Because of your letter?
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_20|“Luke will take it,
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_21|“You go with nothing on?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_22|“What do I care when the child has nothing? I can’t wait to dress,
431.turn_of_the_screw_18_james_64kb_23|“and if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile, yourself, upstairs.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_0|“Do I show it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_1|“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_2|“You came for me for church, of course, but I can’t go.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_3|“Has anything happened?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_4|“Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_5|“Through this window? Dreadful!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_6|“I’ve been frightened.
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_7|“Just what you saw from the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What I saw — just before — was much worse.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_8|“What was it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_9|“An extraordinary man. Looking in.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_10|“What extraordinary man?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_11|“I haven’t the least idea.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_12|“Then where is he gone?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_13|“I know still less.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_14|“Have you seen him before?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_15|“Yes — once. On the old tower.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_16|“Do you mean he’s a stranger?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_17|“Oh, very much!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_18|“Yet you didn’t tell me?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_19|“Ah, I haven’t guessed!
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_20|“How can I if you don’t imagine?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_21|“I don’t in the very least.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_22|“You’ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_23|“And on this spot just now.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_24|“What was he doing on the tower?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_25|“Only standing there and looking down at me.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_26|“Was he a gentleman?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_27|“Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_28|“Nobody — nobody. I didn’t tell you, but I made sure.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_29|“What is he? He’s a horror.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_30|“A horror?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_31|“He’s — God help me if I know what he is!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_32|“It’s time we should be at church.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_33|“Oh, I’m not fit for church!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_34|“Won’t it do you good?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_35|“The children?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_36|“I can’t leave them now.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_37|“You’re afraid — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_38|“I’m afraid of him.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_39|“When was it — on the tower?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_40|“About the middle of the month. At this same hour.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_41|“Almost at dark,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_42|“Oh, no, not nearly. I saw him as I see you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_43|“Then how did he get in?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_44|“And how did he get out?
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_45|“I had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_46|“he has not been able to get in.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_47|“He only peeps?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_48|“I hope it will be confined to that!
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_49|“Go to church. Goodbye. I must watch.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_50|“Do you fear for them?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_51|“You see how he could see,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_52|“How long was he here?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_53|“Till I came out. I came to meet him.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_54|“I couldn’t have come out.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_55|“Neither could I!
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_56|“But I did come. I have my duty.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_57|“So have I mine,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_58|“I’ve been dying to tell you. But he’s like nobody.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_59|“He has no hat.
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_60|“I’ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He’s tall, active, erect,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_61|“but never — no, never! — a gentleman.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_62|“A gentleman?
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_63|“a gentleman he?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_64|“You know him then?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_65|“But he is handsome?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_66|“And dressed — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_67|“In somebody’s clothes.
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_68|“They’re smart, but they’re not his own.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_69|“They’re the master’s!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_70|“You do know him?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_71|“Peter Quint — his own man, his valet, when he was here!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_72|“When the master was?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_73|“He never wore his hat, but he did wear — well, there were waistcoats missed. They were both here — last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_74|“Alone with us.
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_75|“In charge,
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_76|“And what became of him?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_05_james_64kb_77|“He went, too,
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_0|“Well, I think I’m glad Bly agrees with me!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_1|“You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than for some time before. I hope,
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_2|“that you’ve been enjoying yourself.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_3|“Oh, yes, I’ve been ever so far; all round about — miles and miles away. I’ve never been so free.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_4|“Well, do you like it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_5|“Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone together now it’s you that are alone most. But I hope,
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_6|“you don’t particularly mind!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_7|“Having to do with you?
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_8|“My dear child, how can I help minding? Though I’ve renounced all claim to your company — you’re so beyond me — I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_9|“You stay on just for that?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_10|“Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest I take in you till something can be done for you that may be more worth your while. That needn’t surprise you.
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_11|“Don’t you remember how I told you, when I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that there was nothing in the world I wouldn’t do for you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_12|“Only that, I think, was to get me to do something for you!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_13|“It was partly to get you to do something,
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_14|“But, you know, you didn’t do it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_15|“you wanted me to tell you something.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_16|“That’s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_17|“Ah, then, is that what you’ve stayed over for?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_18|“Well, yes — I may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely for that.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_19|“Do you mean now — here?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_20|“There couldn’t be a better place or time.
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_21|“You want so to go out again?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_22|“I’ll tell you everything,
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_23|“I mean I’ll tell you anything you like. You’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I will tell you — I will. But not now.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_24|“Why not now?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_25|“I have to see Luke.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_26|“Well, then, go to Luke, and I’ll wait for what you promise. Only, in return for that, satisfy, before you leave me, one very much smaller request.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_27|“Very much smaller — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_23_james_64kb_28|“Yes, a mere fraction of the whole. Tell me
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_0|“Two hours ago, in the garden
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_1|“Flora saw!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_2|“She has told you?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_3|“Not a word — that’s the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of eight, that child!
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_4|“Then how do you know?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_5|“I was there — I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_6|“Do you mean aware of him?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_7|“No — of her.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_8|“Came how — from where?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_9|“From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there — but not so near.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_10|“And without coming nearer?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_11|“Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as you!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_12|“Was she someone you’ve never seen?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_13|“Yes. But someone the child has. Someone you have.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_14|“My predecessor — the one who died.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_15|“Miss Jessel?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_16|“Miss Jessel. You don’t believe me?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_17|“How can you be sure?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_18|“Then ask Flora — she’s sure!
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_19|“No, for God’s sake, don’t! She’ll say she isn’t — she’ll lie!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_20|“Ah, how can you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_21|“Because I’m clear. Flora doesn’t want me to know.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_22|“It’s only then to spare you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_23|“No, no — there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don’t know what I don’t see — what I don’t fear!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_24|“You mean you’re afraid of seeing her again?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_25|“Oh, no; that’s nothing — now!
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_26|“It’s of not seeing her.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_27|“I don’t understand you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_28|“Why, it’s that the child may keep it up — and that the child assuredly will — without my knowing it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_29|“Dear, dear — we must keep our heads! And after all, if she doesn’t mind it — !
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_30|“Perhaps she likes it!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_31|“Likes such things — a scrap of an infant!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_32|“Isn’t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_33|“Oh, we must clutch at that — we must cling to it! If it isn’t a proof of what you say, it’s a proof of — God knows what! For the woman’s a horror of horrors.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_34|“Tell me how you know,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_35|“Then you admit it’s what she was?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_36|“Tell me how you know,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_37|“Know? By seeing her! By the way she looked.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_38|“At you, do you mean — so wickedly?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_39|“Dear me, no — I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_40|“Fixed her?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_41|“Ah, with such awful eyes!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_42|“Do you mean of dislike?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_43|“God help us, no. Of something much worse.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_44|“Worse than dislike?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_45|“With a determination — indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_46|“Intention?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_47|“To get hold of her.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_48|“That’s what Flora knows.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_49|“The person was in black, you say?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_50|“In mourning — rather poor, almost shabby. But — yes — with extraordinary beauty.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_51|“Oh, handsome — very, very,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_52|“wonderfully handsome. But infamous.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_53|“Miss Jessel — was infamous.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_54|“They were both infamous,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_55|“I appreciate,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_56|“the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_57|“I must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was something between them.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_58|“There was everything.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_59|“In spite of the difference — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_60|“Oh, of their rank, their condition
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_61|“She was a lady.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_62|“Yes — she was a lady.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_63|“And he so dreadfully below,
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_64|“The fellow was a hound.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_65|“I’ve never seen one like him. He did what he wished.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_66|“It must have been also what she wished!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_67|“Poor woman — she paid for it!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_68|“Then you do know what she died of?
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_69|“No — I know nothing. I wanted not to know; I was glad enough I didn’t; and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_70|“Of her real reason for leaving? Oh, yes — as to that. She couldn’t have stayed. Fancy it here — for a governess! And afterward I imagined — and I still imagine. And what I imagine is dreadful.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_07_james_64kb_71|“Not so dreadful as what I do,
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_0|“Look here, my dear, you know,
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_1|“when in the world, please, am I going back to school?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_2|“You know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady always — !
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_3|“And always with the same lady?
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_4|“Ah, of course, she’s a jolly, ‘perfect’ lady; but, after all, I’m a fellow, don’t you see? that’s — well, getting on.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_5|“Yes, you’re getting on.
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_6|“And you can’t say I’ve not been awfully good, can you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_7|“No, I can’t say that, Miles.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_8|“Except just that one night, you know — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_9|“That one night?
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_10|“Why, when I went down — went out of the house.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_11|“Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_12|“You forget?
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_13|“Why, it was to show you I could!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_14|“Oh, yes, you could.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_15|“And I can again.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_16|“Certainly. But you won’t.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_17|“No, not that again. It was nothing.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_18|“It was nothing,
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_19|“But we must go on.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_20|“Then when am I going back?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_21|“Were you very happy at school?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_22|“Oh, I’m happy enough anywhere!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_23|“if you’re just as happy here — !”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_24|“But you hint that you know almost as much?
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_25|“Not half I want to!
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_26|“But it isn’t so much that.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_27|“What is it, then?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_28|“Well — I want to see more life.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_29|“I see; I see.
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_30|“I want my own sort!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_31|“There are not many of your own sort, Miles!
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_32|“Unless perhaps dear little Flora!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_33|“You really compare me to a baby girl?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_34|“Don’t you, then, love our sweet Flora?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_35|“If I didn’t — and you, too; if I didn’t — !
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_36|“Yes, if you didn’t — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_37|“Well, you know what!
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_38|“Does my uncle think what you think?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_39|“How do you know what I think?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_40|“Ah, well, of course I don’t; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I mean does he know?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_41|“Know what, Miles?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_42|“Why, the way I’m going on.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_43|“I don’t think your uncle much cares.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_44|“Then don’t you think he can be made to?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_45|“In what way?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_46|“Why, by his coming down.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_14_james_64kb_47|“But who’ll get him to come down?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_0|“Yes — I took it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_1|“What did you take it for?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_2|“To see what you said about me.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_3|“You opened the letter?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_4|“I opened it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_5|“And you found nothing!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_6|“Nothing, nothing!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_7|“Nothing, nothing,
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_8|“So what have you done with it?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_9|“I’ve burned it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_10|“Is that what you did at school?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_11|“At school?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_12|“Did you take letters? — or other things?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_13|“Other things?
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_14|“Did I steal?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_15|“Was it for that you mightn’t go back?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_16|“Did you know I mightn’t go back?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_17|“I know everything.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_18|“Everything. Therefore did you — ?
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_19|“No. I didn’t steal.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_20|“What then did you do?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_21|“Well — I said things.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_22|“They thought it was enough!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_23|“To turn you out for?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_24|“turned out
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_25|“Well, I suppose I oughtn’t.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_26|“But to whom did you say them?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_27|“I don’t know!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_28|“Was it to everyone?
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_29|“I don’t remember their names.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_30|“Were they then so many?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_31|“No — only a few. Those I liked.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_32|“And did they repeat what you said?
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_33|“they must have repeated them. To those they liked,
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_34|“And these things came round — ?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_35|“To the masters? Oh, yes!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_36|“But I didn’t know they’d tell.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_37|“The masters? They didn’t — they’ve never told. That’s why I ask you.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_38|“Yes, it was too bad.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_39|“Too bad?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_40|“What I suppose I sometimes said. To write home.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_41|“Stuff and nonsense!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_42|“What were these things?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_43|“No more, no more, no more!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_44|“Is she here?
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_45|“Miss Jessel, Miss Jessel!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_46|“It’s not Miss Jessel! But it’s at the window — straight before us. It’s there — the coward horror, there for the last time!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_47|“Whom do you mean by ‘he’?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_48|“Peter Quint — you devil!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_49|“What does he matter now, my own? — what will he ever matter? I have you,
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_50|“but he has lost you forever!
431.turn_of_the_screw_24_james_64kb_51|“There, there!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_0|“I don’t believe anything so horrible,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_1|“You reminded him that Quint was only a base menial?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_2|“As you might say! And it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_3|“And for another thing?
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_4|“He repeated your words to Quint?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_5|“No, not that. It’s just what he wouldn’t!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_6|“I was sure, at any rate,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_7|“that he didn’t. But he denied certain occasions.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_8|“What occasions?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_9|“When they had been about together quite as if Quint were his tutor — and a very grand one — and Miss Jessel only for the little lady. When he had gone off with the fellow, I mean, and spent hours with him.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_10|“He then prevaricated about it — he said he hadn’t?
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_11|“I see. He lied.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_12|“You see, after all, Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She didn’t forbid him.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_13|“Did he put that to you as a justification?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_14|“No, he never spoke of it.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_15|“Never mentioned her in connection with Quint?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_16|“Well, he didn’t show anything. He denied,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_17|“he denied.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_18|“So that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_19|“I don’t know — I don’t know!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_20|“You do know, you dear thing,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_21|“that he covered and concealed their relation.”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_22|“Your learning the truth? I daresay! But, heavens,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_23|“what it shows that they must, to that extent, have succeeded in making of him!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_24|“Ah, nothing that’s not nice now!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_25|“I don’t wonder you looked queer,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_26|“when I mentioned to you the letter from his school!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_27|“I doubt if I looked as queer as you!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_28|“And if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_29|“Yes, indeed — and if he was a fiend at school! How, how, how? Well,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_30|“you must put it to me again, but I shall not be able to tell you for some days. Only, put it to me again!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_31|“There are directions in which I must not for the present let myself go.
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_32|“If Quint — on your remonstrance at the time you speak of — was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_33|“And you forgave him that?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_34|“Wouldn’t you?”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_35|“Oh, yes!
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_36|“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them all!”
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_37|“His having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,
431.turn_of_the_screw_08_james_64kb_38|“They must do, for they make me feel more than ever that I must watch.”

431.turn_of_the_screw_06_james_64kb_32|“Of things that man could do. Quint was so clever — he was so deep.”

5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_22|'The only thing now is -- how would you prefer to pass away? Shall I make you fall over and be devoured by a shark? That would be a picturesque end -- and I could do myself justice over the shark? I should make the young lady weep considerably.'
5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_23|'That won't do at all!
5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_24|'I might work it up into something effective, certainly,
5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_25|'and, by the way, if you are going to expire in my state-room, I ought to know a little more about you than I do. There is time still before the tender goes; you might do worse than spend it in coaching me in your life's history.'
5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_26|'You have saved me,
5957.blackpoodle_14_anstey_64kb_27|'Now I can banish every recollection of this miserable episode. I need no longer preserve my poor aunt's directions; let them go, then.'

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_3|'what can be the matter with him?'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_4|'Not a single cap off -- not one solitary hurray,

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_6|'I don't think it's anything to do with me, really,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_7|'What does it mean?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_8|'it looks to me, do you know, rather as if your late lamented husband has changed his mind about dying, and is on his way to your arms.'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_9|'Then he is not dead!
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_10|'He is coming home. I shall look upon that face, hear that voice, press that hand once again! How excessively annoying!'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_11|'Confounded nuisance!
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_12|'Well, it's all over with the betrothal after this; don't you think it would be as well to get all the arches, and fireworks, and things out of the way? We shan't want them now, you know.'

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_17|'I wish you to stay. Who knows what may happen?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_18|'We may be happy yet!'

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_22|'Will you kindly count the boxes?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_23|'there should be four -- a tin cocked-hat box, two camel-hair trunks, and a carpet bag.'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_24|'Nay, but with bursting hearts would we bid thee thrice hail!'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_25|'Once is ample, thank you,

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_29|'How de do, my love; how de do?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_30|'I shan't give you another obol!

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_32|'She has kindly consented to stay on a little longer, my love,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_33|'It varied, sir,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_34|'the climate varied. I used to get very warm fighting sometimes.'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_35|'I wore it all through the campaign. Your true warrior is no dandy!'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_36|'We were given to understand you were wounded,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_37|'yes; I was considerably wounded -- all over the chest and arms. But what cared I?'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_38|'and, curiously enough, the weapons don't seem to have pierced your coat at all. I observe there are no patches.'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_39|'I want to see it drawn,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_40|'I want to look upon the keen flashing blade which has penetrated the inmost recesses of so many of our country's foes. Oh, it won't come out,

5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_42|'Troy really has fallen then?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_43|'I suppose you stayed to see the thing out?'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_44|'I sacked the most fashionable quarters myself. I expect my booty will be forwarded -- shortly. Didn't you know Troy was taken?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_45|'Couldn't you see the beacon I lighted just before I started?'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_46|'What do you mean by that? How do you know how long it took?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_47|'Don't you see?
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_48|'You are not a time-table, my love,
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_49|'I won't trouble you for all these details. Come to the point.'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_50|'that we have only just seen the beacon flame arrive here at Arachnæus, after leaping from height to height across lake and plain; so that you, my dearest, must have made the distance with almost equal celerity!'
5957.blackpoodle_06_anstey_64kb_51|'I came with the beacon,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_0|'I don't understand,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_1|'Tell me what you are talking about.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_2|'What she could have said to convey such an idea passes my comprehension,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_3|'but she knows nothing -- she's a mere child. I have felt from the first, my boy, that your aunt's intention was to benefit you quite as much as my own daughter. Believe me, I shall not attempt to restrict you in any way; I shall be too rejoiced to see you come forth in safety from the Grey Chamber.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_4|'Go back to your piano, my child,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_5|'Augustus and I have much to talk about which is not for your ears.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_6|'you must not tell her; it will kill her; she is not strong!
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_7|'it was for your own good that the whole truth has been thus concealed from you; but now, perhaps, the time has come when the truest kindness will be to reveal all. What do you say, Augustus?'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_8|'I -- I agree with you,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_9|'she ought to be told.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_10|'Break to her, then, the nature of the ordeal which lies before you.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_11|'Well, so be it,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_12|'Chlorine, compose yourself, dearest one; sit down there, and summon up all your fortitude to hear what I am about to tell you. You must know, then -- I think you had better let your mother give you a cup of tea before I begin; it will steady your nerves.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_13|'It is now,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_14|'And are you one of its thralls then, papa?
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_15|'I am, indeed,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_16|'But, Sir Paul,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_17|'Sir Paul, you -- you mustn't stop there, or you'll alarm Chlorine more than there's any need to do. She -- ha, ha! -- don't you see, she has got some idea into her head that I have to go through much the same sort of thing. Just explain that to her. I'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_18|'You mean well, Augustus,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_19|'but the time for deceiving her has gone by; she must know the worst. Yes, my poor child,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_20|'unhappily, though our beloved Augustus is not a Catafalque himself, he has of his own free will brought himself within the influence of the Curse, and he, too, at the appointed hour, must keep the awful assignation, and brave all that the most fiendish malevolence can do to shake his resolution.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_21|'You see,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_22|'In 1770, it is true, one solitary suitor was emboldened by love and daring to face the ordeal. He went calmly and resolutely to the chamber where the Curse was then lodged, and the next morning they found him outside the door -- a gibbering maniac!'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_23|'promise me you will not permit the Curse to turn you into a gibbering maniac. I think if I saw you gibber I should die!'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_24|'Nay, Chlorine,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_25|'there is no cause for alarm; all has been made smooth for Augustus.
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_26|'It's simply astonishing to me,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_27|'that in the nineteenth century, hardly six miles from Charing Cross, you can calmly allow this hideous "Curse," or whatever you call it, to have things all its own way like this.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_28|'What can I do, Augustus?
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_29|'Do? Anything!
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_30|'Not go near it!
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_31|'Not on any account,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_32|'If the Curse has any business with me, let it come down and settle it here before you all in a plain straightforward manner. Let us go about it in a business-like way. On second thoughts,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_33|'I won't meet it anywhere!'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_34|'And why -- why won't you meet it?
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_35|'m a materialist.
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_36|'How can I have any dealings with a preposterous supernatural something which my reason forbids me to believe in? You see my difficulty? It would be inconsistent, to begin with, and -- and extremely painful to both sides.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_37|'No more of this ribaldry,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_38|'It may be terribly remembered against you when the hour comes. Keep a guard over your tongue, for all our sakes, and more especially your own. Recollect that the Curse knows all that passes beneath this roof. And do not forget, too, that you are pledged -- irrevocably pledged. You must confront the Curse!'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_39|'I had no right to pledge myself,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_40|'under all the circumstances.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_41|'what circumstances?'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_42|'Well, in the first place,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_43|'m not Augustus McFadden at all. My real name is of no consequence -- but it's a prettier one than that. As for McFadden, he, I regret to say, is now no more.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_44|'If this is true, sir,
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_45|'you have indeed deceived us basely.'
5957.blackpoodle_16_anstey_64kb_46|'When I described McFadden as dead,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_0|'I do wish I was back in Regent Street again,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_1|'Are you very dull here then?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_2|'Dull! You were never in Regent Street, or you wouldn't ask such a question.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_3|'I came from the Lowther Arcade,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_4|'Oh, really?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_5|'then, of course, this would be quite a pleasant change for you.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_6|'I liked the Arcade. It was so lively; a little noisy perhaps -- too much top spinning, and pop-gunning, and mouth-organ playing all round one -- but very cheerful. Yes, I liked the Arcade.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_7|'Very mixed the society there, isn't it?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_8|'aren't you expected to know penny things?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_9|'Well, there were a good many penny things there,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_10|'and very amusing they were. There was a wooden bird there that used to duck his head and wag his tail when they swung a weight underneath -- he would have made you laugh so!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_11|'I should never so far forget myself as to laugh under any circumstances -- and certainly not at a penny thing!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_12|'I wonder how much he cost?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_13|'not very much, I can see from his manner. But perhaps I can get him to tell me. Do you remember,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_14|'Do you mean my price?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_15|'oh, elevenpence three farthings -- it was on the ticket.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_16|'What a vulgar creature!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_17|'I shall really have to drop him.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_18|'that's the fair selling price.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_19|'Well, that's very curious,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_20|'I suppose he is,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_21|'it's his business, you know.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_22|'I don't see how you can possibly tell,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_23|'the Lowther Arcade is not Regent Street.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_24|'And were you very happy at Regent Street?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_25|'I don't think you'll find it so very bad here, when you get a little more used to it,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_26|'Pray don't use that very unpleasant word,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_27|'Did you never hear of "dolls
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_28|'Well, our hostess, then -- Winifred, she's not unkind. She doesn't care much about me, and that cousin of hers, Master Archie, gives me a bad time of it when I come in his way, but really she's very polite and attentive to you.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_29|'Polite and attentive!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_30|'I don't call it an attention to be treated like a baby by a little chit of a girl who can't dress herself properly yet -- no style, no elegance, and actually a pinafore in the mornings!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_31|'Then the society here,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_32|'Well, I prefer make-believe tea myself,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_33|'because, you see, I can't get the orange-juice down, and so it's rather bad for the dress and complexion.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_34|'What is a romance?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_35|'I thought you wouldn't understand me,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_36|'a romance is -- well, there's champagne in it, and cigarettes, to begin with.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_37|'But what is champagne?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_38|'Something you drink,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_39|'what else could it be?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_40|'a sort of orange-juice.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_41|'Do you mind telling me what a heroine is?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_42|'A heroine? oh, any doll can be a heroine. I felt all the time the heroines were all just like me. They were either very good or very wicked, and I'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_43|'I should think it would be more uncomfortable,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_44|'Ah, but then you see you haven't any sentiment about you,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_45|'I should think not,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_46|'it's very expensive.
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_47|'you were talking of Master Archie just now. I rather like that boy, do you know. I believe I could make something of him if he would only let me.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_48|'He's a mischievous boy,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_49|'and ill-natured too.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_50|'Yes, isn't he?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_51|'I like him for that. I fancy a duke or a guardsman must be something like him; they all had just his wicked black eyes and long restless fingers. It wouldn't be quite so dull if he would notice me a little; but he never will!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_52|'He's going back to school next week,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_53|'So soon!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_54|'There's hardly time for him to make a real heroine of me before that. How I wish he would! I shouldn't care how he did it, or what came of it. I'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_55|'Say that again, my dainty little lady; say it again!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_56|'and, if you really mean it, perhaps the old Sausage-Glutton can manage it for you. He's done more wonderful things than that in his time, I can tell you.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_57|'Sausage-Glutton,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_58|'who is that person?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_59|'Don't -- oh, please don't!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_60|'You won't like it -- you won't, really!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_61|'Don't trust him,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_62|'he's a bad old man; he ruined a very promising young dancing nigger only the other day, unhinged him so that he will never hook on any more.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_63|'re second cousins,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_64|'and they don't mean any harm by it; it's only their high spirits. And whatever you say, I'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_65|'My good creatures,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_66|'you mean well, no doubt, but pray leave this gentleman and me to settle our own affairs. Can you really get Master Archie to take some notice of me, sir?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_67|'I can, my loveliest,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_68|'And will it be exciting,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_69|'and romantic, and -- and just the least bit wicked, too?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_70|'You shall be the very wickedest heroine in any nursery in the world,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_71|'Oh, dear me, how you will enjoy yourself!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_72|'Then I accept,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_73|'I put myself quite in your hands -- I leave everything to you.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_74|'that's a brave little beauty. It's a bargain, then? To-morrow afternoon the fun will begin, and then -- my springs and wheels -- what a time you will have of it! He, he! You look out for Archibald!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_75|'You are a fairy, aren't you?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_76|'can't you do anything to help her?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_77|'But I never gave him leave to meddle with me,

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_79|'only the bellows I squeak with, and wire. But why?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_80|'I don't mind for myself so much, but I should like to prevent any harm from coming to her. I'll remember.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_81|'You didn't believe what the old man on the clock told you about me, did you? I'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_82|'m only a poor jester, and you'r
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_83|'for the sake of the giver,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_84|'are you all alone?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_85|'Nurse has gone downstairs,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_86|'I've got the dolls, but it's dull here somehow. Can't you come and help me to play, Archie?'

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_89|'Ah, but then you played at being a slave-driver, Archie, and you made me sell you my old black Dinah for a slave, and then you tied her up and whipped her. I didn't like that game! But if you'll stay this time, I won't mind what else you do!'

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_94|'He has noticed me at last,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_95|'I wonder if I could make him fall desperately in love with me!

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_97|'That's Ethelinda, Archie -- isn't she pretty?'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_98|'I've seen them uglier,

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_101|'You leave that to me. I've an idea, something much better than your silly tea-parties.'

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_103|'we don't want her!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_104|'Now listen, Winifred,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_105|'this is the game. You'r

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_107|'Go on, Archie; I see,
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_108|'and I like it so far.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_109|'I think I ought to have been the queen!
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_110|'I'll tell you something. This maid of honour of yours doesn't like you (don't say she does, now; I'

5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_112|'he knows exactly how I feel!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_113|'Do you really think it's that, Archie?
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_114|'it's just what I was afraid of before you came in.'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_115|'That's it. Look out for a kind of glare in her eye when I pay you any attention. (How does Your Majesty do? Well, I hope.) There, didn't you see it? Well, that's jealousy, that is. She hates you like anything!'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_116|'Oh, well, if you know better than I do, you can finish it for yourself. I'
5957.blackpoodle_10_anstey_64kb_117|'No, no; do stay. I like it. I'll be good after this!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_0|'Now you'll see how artful she is; she's coming to ask you if she may go out. Listen. "Please, Your Gracious Majesty, may I go out for a little while?"'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_1|'This is even better than if I spoke myself,

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_3|'Am I to speak to her, Archie?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_4|'Of course you are. Go on; don't be silly; give her leave.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_5|'Certainly, Ethelinda, if you wish it,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_6|'but I should like you to be in to prayers.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_7|'A maid of honour isn't the same as a housemaid, you know,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_8|'but never mind -- she's off. You don't see where she goes, of course.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_9|'Ah, but not in the game; nobody does. She goes to the apothecary's -- here's the apothecary.
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_10|'I've bought some poison now,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_11|'I am a wicked doll! How convenient it is to have it all done for one like this! I do hope he's going to make me give Winifred some of that stuff, to get her out of the way, and have the romance all to our two selves.'

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_13|'haven't the least idea of all this. But one day, the Court jester (

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_16|'Now look here, Winnie, I can't have this sort of thing every minute. For a gentleman, it might be rather mean, perhaps, but then I'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_17|'Poisin for the Queen!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_18|'There, what do you think of that?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_19|'looks bad, doesn't it?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_20|'perhaps it was only in fun?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_21|'Fun -- there's not much fun about her! Now the guard
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_22|'arrests her. Do you want to ask the prisoner any questions? -- you can if you like.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_23|'You -- you didn't mean to poison me really, did you, Ethelinda dear?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_24|'Archie, do make her say something!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_25|'Why can't you answer when the Queen asks you a question, eh?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_26|'No, she won't say a word; she'll only grin at you; you see she's quite hardened. There's only one thing that would make her confess,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_27|'and that's the torture. I could make a beautiful rack, Winnie, if you didn't mind?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_28|'Whatever she's done,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_29|'Then why doesn't she say so?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_30|'No, no, Winnie. Look here, this is a serious thing, you know; it won't do to pass it over; it's high treason, and she'll have to be tried.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_31|'But I don't want her tried,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_32|'Oh, very well then; I had better go downstairs again and read. The best part was all coming, but if you don't care, I'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_33|'Little idiot!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_34|'she'll spoil the whole thing; every heroine has to be tried!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_35|'Well, then, she shall be tried if you really think she ought to be, Archie; it won't hurt her though, will it?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_36|'Of course it won't; it's all right. Now for the trial: here's the court, and here's a place for the judge
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_37|'here's the dock -- stick Lady What's-her-name inside -- that's it. We must do without a jury, but I suppose we ought to have a judge; oh, this fellow will do for judge!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_38|'m glad of it -- I'll let her off!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_39|'Oh, but Archie,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_40|'can a jester be a judge?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_41|'judges make jokes sometimes -- I've heard papa say so, and he's a barrister, and ought to know.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_42|'But this one doesn't make real jokes!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_43|'Who asked him to? Judges are not obliged to make jokes, Winnie. I believe you are trying to get her off, but I'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_44|'There, Archie, you can't say she didn't speak that time!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_45|'Now, you have done it!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_46|'If she'd confessed, we might have shown mercy. Now we shall have to prove it, and if we do I'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_47|'If she says "Guilty, and she won't do it again!"
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_48|'It's too late for that now,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_49|'no, we must prove it.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_50|'But how are you going to prove it?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_51|'You wait. I've been in court once or twice with papa, and seen him prove all sorts of things. First, we must have in the fellow who sold the poison -- the apothecary, you know. Oh, I say, though, I forgot that -- he's the judge; that won't do!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_52|'Then you can't prove it after all -- I'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_53|'One would think you rather liked being poisoned,
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_54|'I like magnesia, and it isn't poison, really -- it's medicine.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_55|'What's a sentence?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_56|'You'll see; this is the judge talking now: "Lady Ethelinda, you've been found guilty of very bad conduct; you've put arsenic in your beloved Queen's tea!"'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_57|'Why, I haven't had tea yet!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_58|'m sorry to tell you that we shall have to cut your head off!"'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_59|'What have I done?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_60|'it will all come right in the end; it always does.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_61|'she mustn't have her head cut off.'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_62|'It will be all right, Winnie, if you will only leave it to me and not interfere. You promised not to interrupt, and yet you will keep on doing it!'

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_64|'she's in prison now, languishing in her prison cell, and do you know, I rather think her heart's beginning to soften a little: she wants you to come and see her. You won't refuse her last request, Winnie, will you?'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_65|'As if I could!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_66|'I -- I can't, Archie!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_67|'If you don't, she'll think you'r
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_68|'m gone and mouldering away in my felon's grave it will be too late then, and you'll be sorry. It's the last thing I shall ever ask you!"'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_69|'Oh, Ethelinda, darling, don't!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_70|'don't go on talking in that dreadful way; I can't bear it. Archie, I must forgive her now!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_71|'Oh yes, forgive her,

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_73|'she's quite good again. Now let's play at something not quite so horrid!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_74|'When we've done with this, we will; but it isn't half over yet; there's all the execution to come. It's the fatal day now, the dismal scaffold is erected

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_76|'the trembling criminal is brought out amidst the groans of the populace (groan, Winnie, can't you?)'

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_82|'is led tottering to the block, and then the headsman, very respectfully, cuts off some of her beautiful golden hair, so that it shouldn't get in his way.'

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_86|'What shall I do without her?
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_87|'how can I bear it. Ah, I ought to be lying there -- not she. I wish I could take her place!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_88|'Do make haste, Archie,

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_93|'Stop, Archie, what do you mean? Did you think you'd cut her head off really!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_94|'I cut something's head off; I saw it go!'
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_95|'Then you did mean it! And, oh, it's the jester! I wouldn't have minded it so much, if you hadn't meant it for Ethelinda! And, Archie, you cruel, bad boy -- you've cut -- cut all her beautiful hair off, and I sat here and let you! She's not pretty at all now -- it's a shame, it is a shame!'

5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_99|'I don't believe you one bit!
5957.blackpoodle_11_anstey_64kb_100|'You had no business to cut even my jester's head off, but you meant to do much worse! I won't play with you any more, and I shan't forgive you till the very day you go back to school!'

5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_28|'How can I know?
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_29|'I shall never die -- unless -- unless something happens which will never be!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_30|'No, you are wrong,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_31|'I am not cruel, as you think me; when they are no longer pleasant to look at, I leave them. I never see them borne away. I never thought what became of them at last. Where are they now?'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_32|'They are dead, siren,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_33|'You can let them sail by unharmed,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_34|'Of what use is my power to me if I may not exercise it? Why do you tell me of men's sufferings -- what are they to me?'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_35|'They give you their lives,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_36|'you fill them with a hopeless love and they die for it in misery -- yet you cannot even pity them!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_37|'Is it love that brings them here?
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_38|'What is this that is called love? For I have always known that if I ever love -- but then only -- I must die, though what love may be I know not. Tell me, so that I may avoid it!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_39|'You need not fear, siren,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_40|'for, if death is only to come to you through love, you will never die!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_41|'Still, I want to know,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_42|'If that is love,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_43|'I shall indeed never die! But that is not how men love me?
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_44|'their love for you must be some strange and enslaving passion, since they will submit to death if only they may hear your voice. That is not true love, but a fatal madness.'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_45|'But if mortals feel love for one another,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_46|'The love of a man for a maiden who is gentle and good does not kill -- even when it is most hopeless,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_47|'and where she feels it in return, it is well for both, for their lives will flow on together in peace and happiness.'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_48|'And you love one of your mortal maidens like that?
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_49|'Is she more beautiful than I am?'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_50|'but she is fair and gracious, my maiden; and it is she who has my love, and will have it while I live.'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_51|'I could make you forget her.'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_52|'even you cannot make me false to my love! And yet,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_53|'I dare not challenge you, enchantress that you are; what is my will against your power?'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_54|'You do not love me yet,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_55|'you have called me cruel, and reproached me; you have dared to tell me of a maiden compared with whom I am nothing! You shall be punished. I will have you for my own, like the others!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_56|'take my life if you will -- but do not drive away the memory of my love; let me die, if I must die, faithful to her; for what am I, or what is my love, to you?'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_57|'yet I want you; you shall lie here, and hold my hand, and look into my eyes, and forget all else but me.'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_58|'I choose life while I may!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_59|'You have no choice,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_60|'you are mine!
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_61|'The next wave will carry you away,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_62|'there is still time; save yourself, for I cannot let you die!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_63|'It was true, then,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_64|'it is love that I feel for him. But I cannot love -- I must not love him -- for if I do, my power is gone, and I must throw myself into the sea!'
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_65|'If one of us must die,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_66|'I will be that one. I am cruel and wicked, as he told me; I have done harm enough!
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_67|'You are safe now,
5957.blackpoodle_13_anstey_64kb_68|'you shall not be drowned -- for I love you. Sail back to your maiden on the mainland, and be happy; but do not hate me for the evil I have wrought, for suffering and death have come to me in my turn!'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_0|'You are indeed welcome,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_1|'We thank you for this proof of your chivalry and devotion. It cannot be but that such courage and such self-sacrifice will meet with their reward!'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_2|'You have made an old man very happy and hopeful,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_3|'I ought, even now to deter you, but I am too selfish for that. And you are young and brave and ardent; why need we despair? I suppose,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_4|'you would prefer as little delay as possible?'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_5|'I should indeed,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_6|'Say nothing of this to Chlorine,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_7|'until the final arrangements are made; it will only distress her unnecessarily.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_8|'Prepare yourself, Augustus
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_9|'all is arranged. The event upon which our dearest hopes depend is fixed for to-morrow -- in the Grey Chamber of course, and at midnight.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_10|'But you do not know the Grey Chamber,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_11|'Come with me, and I will show you where it is.
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_12|'To-morrow night is Christmas Eve, as you are doubtless aware,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_13|'At twelve, then, you will present yourself at yonder door -- the door of the Grey Chamber -- where you must fulfil the engagement you have made.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_14|'Such extreme sensitiveness, my love,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_15|'may be highly creditable to your sense of maidenly propriety, but allow me to say that I can scarcely regard it as a compliment.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_16|'you must not think I doubt you; and yet -- and yet -- the ordeal will be a severe one for you.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_17|'I will steel my nerves,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_18|'and, after all, Chlorine, the ceremony is not invariably fatal; I have heard of the victim surviving it -- occasionally.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_19|'How brave you are!
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_20|'I will imitate you, Augustus; I too will hope.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_21|'Yes, I am weak, foolish, I know,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_22|'but oh, I shudder so when I think of you, away in that gloomy Grey Chamber, going through it all alone!'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_23|'May I ask where you intend to be at the time?
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_24|'You will not think us unfeeling,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_25|'but dear papa considered that such anxiety as ours would be scarcely endurable did we not seek some distraction from it; and so, as a special favour, he has procured evening orders for Sir John Soane's Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where we shall drive immediately after dinner.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_26|'If you are forgetting your anxiety in Sir John Soane's Museum, while I cool my heels in the Grey Chamber,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_27|'is it probable that any clergyman will be induced to perform the marriage ceremony? Did you really think two people can be united separately?'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_28|'you cannot really believe that we are to be married in -- in the Grey Chamber?'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_29|'Then will you tell me where we are to be married?
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_30|'I think I have the right to know -- it can hardly be at the Museum!'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_31|'I could almost fancy,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_32|'that this is no feigned ignorance. Augustus, your aunt sent you a message -- tell me, have you read it?'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_33|'Why of course, darling, of course,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_34|'You must think no more of my silly joke; there is something I have to arrange in the Grey Chamber before I can call you mine. But, tell me, why does it make you so uneasy?
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_35|'I cannot help it -- no, I cannot!
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_36|'the test is so searching -- are you sure that you are prepared at all points? I overheard my father say that no precaution could safely be neglected. I have such a terrible foreboding that, after all, this may come between us.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_37|'Why will you persist in treating me like a child, Augustus?
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_38|'They have tried to hide it all from me, but do you suppose I do not know that in the Grey Chamber you will have to encounter one far more formidable, far more difficult to satisfy, than poor dear papa?'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_39|'I see you know more than I -- more than I thought you did,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_40|'Let us understand one another, Chlorine -- tell me exactly how much you know.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_41|'I have told you all I know,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_42|'it is your turn to confide in me.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_43|'Not even for your sweet sake, my dearest,
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_44|'can I break the seal that is set upon my tongue. You must not press me. Come, let us talk of other things.'
5957.blackpoodle_15_anstey_64kb_45|'for her separate use and free from the control of her husband,

5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_1|'that I'd sooner see her married to after to-day. You'r

5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_3|'I never saw Bingo do such a thing before in his life!'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_4|'never learnt that from me.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_5|'I tell you what I fancy it is,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_6|'You see, he was always a sensitive, excitable animal, and perhaps the -- the sudden joy of his return has gone to his head -- upset him, you know.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_7|'It's very odd,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_8|'but I always thought that it was half the right ear that Bingo had lost?'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_9|'So it is, isn't it?
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_10|'Left, eh? Well, I thought myself it was the right.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_11|'Oh, it was the left,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_12|'I know it because I remember so particularly thinking how odd it was that it should be the left ear, and not the right!
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_13|'My dear fellow, I can't tell you,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_14|'everything seems odd when you come to think at all about it.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_15|'will you tell Aunt Mary and Mr. Travers, and -- and me, how it was you came to find Bingo? Mr. Travers is quite anxious to hear all about it.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_16|'There's a foreign-looking man staring over the hedge,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_17|'Bingo always did hate foreigners.'

5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_35|'it's all very well to say that, but how can you prove it? I give you my word that the dog belongs to me! You must prove your claim, eh, Travers?'

5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_50|'Why, Weatherhead, have you lost faith too, then?
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_51|'m afraid I've been deceived by the extraordinary likeness. I don't think, on reflection, that that is Bingo!'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_52|'What do you think, Travers?
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_53|'Well, since you ask me,
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_54|'I never did think so.'
5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_55|'I thought from the first that was never my Bingo. Why, Bingo would make two of that beast!'

5957.blackpoodle_03_anstey_64kb_57|'you did your best -- there was a sort of likeness, to any one who didn't know Bingo as we did.'

5957.blackpoodle_07_anstey_64kb_3|'I did not intend to chide you. It is only that I have grown so accustomed to the frugal, hardy life of a camp, that I have imbibed a soldier's contempt for luxury.'
5957.blackpoodle_07_anstey_64kb_4|'You prophesy, do you not?
5957.blackpoodle_07_anstey_64kb_5|'might we beg you to favour us with a prediction -- just a little one?'
5957.blackpoodle_07_anstey_64kb_6|'I see before me,
5957.blackpoodle_07_anstey_64kb_7|'a proud and stately pile -- but enter not. See ye yon ghoul among the chimney-pots, yon amphisboena in the back garden? And the scent of gore pervades it!'

6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_26|"Not you. Only a sham. Why, your clothes don't fit you, and your cap's put on all skew-rew. Don't look a bit like a fisher-lad, and never will."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_27|"Never mind about that; let me out of this place."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_28|"Because I want my liberty."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_29|"Not you. Looks comf'table enough as you are. I say, do you know what you are like now?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_30|"I told you, a fisher-boy!
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_31|"Not you. Look like a wild beast in a cage. Like a monkey."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_32|"It was your turn yesterday, it's mine to-day. What a game! You laughed and fleered at me when I was on the cutter's deck. I can laugh and fleer at you now. I say, you do look a rum 'un. Just like a big monkey in a show."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_33|"Gentlemen don't fight with low, common fellows like you, but if you do not come round and let me out, next time we meet I'll have a bit of rope's-end ready for you."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_34|"Why, I could tie you up in a knot, and heave you off the cliff any day. What a game! Bit of a middy, fed on salt tack and weevilly biscuit, talk of giving me rope's-end! Dressed up with a dirty face and a bit o' canvas! Go back aboard, and put on your uniform. Ha! Ha! Ha!"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_35|"Once more; will you come and let me out?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_36|"No. I'm going to keep you here till the gentlefolks get up, and then I'll bring 'em round to see the monkey in his cage, just like they do in the shows, when you pay a penny. See you for nothing, middy. I say, where's your sword? Why don't you draw it, and come out and fight? I'll fight you with a stick."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_37|"You insolent young scoundrel!

6670.cutlassandcudgel_13_fenn_64kb_39|"Keep still, or you'll get your weasand slit. D'ye hear?"

6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_1|"Mr Raystoke, sir? Oh yes."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_2|"I mean liked his job?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_3|"Yes, sir; determined on it."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_4|"Humph! Time we had some news of him, eh?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_5|"Yes, sir; but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_6|"Yes. Men quite ready?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_7|"That's right. Of course, well-armed?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_8|"Yes, sir; you did tell me. Soon as the signal comes, we shall push off. Awkward bit o' country, sir; six miles' row before you can find a place to land."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_9|"Very awkward, but they have to find a place to land their spirits, Mr Gurr, and if we don't soon have something to show we shall be called to account."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_10|"Very unlucky, sir. Seems to me like going eel-fishing with your bare hand."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_11|"Worse. You might catch one by accident."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_12|"So shall we yet, sir. These fellows are very cunning, but we shall be too many for them one of these days."

6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_14|"I don't like this at all I don't think I ought to have let a boy like that go alone. You don't think, Mr Gurr, that they would dare to injure him if he was so unlucky as to be caught?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_15|"smugglers are smugglers."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_16|"will you have the goodness to talk sense?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_17|"Smugglers are smugglers, indeed. What did you suppose I thought they were? Oysters?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_18|"Beg pardon, sir; didn't mean any harm."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_19|"I shall be obliged to send you on shore, Mr Gurr. You must go and find him. I'm getting very anxious about Mr Raystoke."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_20|"No, wait another half-hour. Very ill-advised thing to do. I cannot think what you were doing, Mr Gurr, to advise me to do such a thing."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_21|"Yes. A great pity. I ought not to have listened to you; but in my anxiety to leave no stone unturned to capture some of these scoundrels, I was ready to do anything."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_22|"Now, my good fellow, what do you mean by that?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_23|"It was only an observation, sir."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_24|"Then I must request that you will not make it again. `Very true?' Of course, what I say is very true. Do you think I should say a thing that was false?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_25|"Beg pardon, sir. 'Fraid I picked up some awk'ard expressions aboard the old frigate."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_26|"Awk-ward, Mr Gurr, awkward."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_27|"Yes, sir; of course."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_28|"You do not understand the drift of my remarks."

6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_30|"I was trying to teach you to pronounce the king's English correctly, and you turn it off with a ribald remark."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_31|"Beg pardon, sir. 'Nother o' my frigate bad habits."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_32|"It is a great privilege, Mr Gurr, to be one of those who speak the English tongue, so do not abuse it. Say awk-ward in future, not awk'ard."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_33|"Certainly, sir, I'll try,
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_34|"Starboard, larboard, for'ard, back'ard, awk'ard. Why, what does he mean?"

Dunno though; bit cocky and nose in air when he's in full uniform, and don't know which is head and which is his heels, but he aren't such a very bad sort o' boy. Well, what's the matter with you?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_37|"Don't turn yourself into a figurehead of an old wreck sir. What do you want?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_38|"Leave to go ashore, sir."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_39|"Well, you're going soon as the skipper orders."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_40|"I mean all alone by myself, sir."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_41|"What for? There aren't a public-house for ten miles."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_42|"Then what did you mean? Speak out, and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_43|"Hopping about like a cat on hot bricks. Now, then, why do you want to go ashore?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_44|"Try and find Mr Raystoke, sir. Beginning to feel scarred about him."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_45|"Beg pardon, didn't mean nowt, sir,
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_46|"Yes, you did, sir. Now look here,
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_47|"don't you try to deceive me. You meant that you were getting uneasy about Mr Raystoke's prolonged absence."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_48|"Then how dare you have the effrontery to tell me that you did not mean `nowt' as you have the confounded north country insolence to call it? For two pins, sir, -- women's pins, sir, not belaying pins, -- I'd have you put ashore, with orders not to show your dirty face again till you had found Mr Raystoke."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_49|"Shall I go at once sir?"
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_50|"No. Wait. Keep a sharp look-out on the cliff to see if Mr Raystoke is making signals for a boat. I daresay he has been there all the time, only you took up my attention with your chatter."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_51|"Pipe away the men to that boat there,
6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_52|"I'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions."

6670.cutlassandcudgel_15_fenn_64kb_54|"I say, sir, I have only one order to give you. Get ashore as soon as you can, and find and bring back Mr Raystoke."

Making all this fuss about a boy who, as like as not, is having a game with us. Don't see me getting out o' temper with everybody, and spitting and swearing like a mad Tom-cat. Hang the boy! He's on'y a middy. -- Now, my lads, -- now, my lads, put your backs into it, will you?"

6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_4|"I was obliged to come. It was by accident I came into this room. I was trying to find out about the smugglers."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_5|"And -- and -- you have not found out anything?
6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_6|"What am I to say? I am on duty. Yes, I have found out all I wanted to know."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_7|"I wish you would believe me, that I am in as great trouble about it as you are."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_8|"But your men. They are close here, then, and they frightened these people away."
6670.cutlassandcudgel_12_fenn_64kb_9|"I suppose so. I don't know,

7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_20|“I believe what I know.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_21|“I swear to you.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_22|“Listen to me, my dear M. Baisemeaux; I say yes, you say no; one of us two necessarily says what is true, and the other, it inevitably follows, what is false.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_23|“Well, we shall come to an understanding presently.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_24|“Now drink your glass of muscat, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_25|“What the devil! you look quite scared.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_26|“No, no; not the least in the world; oh, no.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_27|“Oh! be sure beforehand that I shall not understand anything.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_28|“Well, well!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_29|“Try, now; let us see!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_30|“That is what I am going to do.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_31|“If, on the contrary, you are one of the members of this society, you will immediately answer me -- yes or no.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_32|“Begin your questions,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_33|“You will agree, dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_34|“that it is evident a man cannot be a member of a society, it is evident that he cannot enjoy the advantages it offers to the affiliated, without being himself bound to certain little services.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_35|“I should not like to say absolutely.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_36|“There is an engagement entered into by all the governors and captains of fortresses affiliated to the order.
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_37|“Now the engagement,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_38|“is of this nature.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_39|“Go on, dear M. d’Herblay: go on,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_40|“The aforesaid captain or governor of a fortress shall allow to enter, when need shall arise, and on demand of the prisoner, a confessor affiliated to the order.
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_41|“Is not that the text of the agreement?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_42|“Ah! well, you begin to understand, I think.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_43|“do not trifle so with my unhappy mind! I find myself as nothing in your hands, if you have the malignant desire to draw from me the little secrets of my administration.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_44|“Oh! by no means; pray undeceive yourself, dear M. Baisemeaux; it is not the little secrets of your administration, but those of your conscience that I aim at.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_45|“Well, then, my conscience be it, dear M. d’Herblay. But have some consideration for the situation I am in, which is no ordinary one.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_46|“It is no ordinary one, my dear monsieur,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_47|“if you are a member of this society; but it is a quite natural one if free from all engagement. You are answerable only to the king.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_48|“Well, monsieur, well! I obey only the king, and whom else would you have a French nobleman obey?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_49|“It is very pleasant,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_50|“for a French nobleman, for a prelate of France, to hear a man of your mark express himself so loyally, dear De Baisemeaux, and having heard you to believe no more than you do.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_51|“Have you doubted, monsieur?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_52|“I? oh, no!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_53|“And so you doubt no longer?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_54|“I have no longer any doubt that such a man as you, monsieur,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_55|“does not faithfully serve the masters whom he voluntarily chose for himself.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_56|“Yes, masters, I said.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_57|“Monsieur d’Herblay, you are still jesting, are you not?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_58|“Oh, yes! I understand that it is a more difficult position to have several masters than one; but the embarrassment is owing to you, my dear Baisemeaux, and I am not the cause of it.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_59|“Certainly not,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_60|“but what are you doing? You are leaving the table?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_61|“Yes, I am going.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_62|“But you are behaving very strangely towards me, monseigneur.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_63|“I am behaving strangely -- how do you make that out?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_64|“Have you sworn, then, to put me to the torture?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_65|“No, I should be sorry to do so.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_66|“Because I have no longer anything to do here; and, indeed, I have duties to fulfil elsewhere.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_67|“Duties, so late as this?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_68|“The confessor affiliated to the order,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_69|“The confessor!
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_70|“you, monseigneur, the confessor of the order!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_71|“Yes, I; but we have nothing to unravel together, seeing that you are not one of the affiliated.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_72|“And I understand that, not being so, you refuse to comply with its command.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_73|“Monseigneur, I beseech you, condescend to hear me.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_74|“Monseigneur, I do not say that I have nothing to do with the society.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_75|“I say not that I refuse to obey.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_76|“Nevertheless, M. de Baisemeaux, what has passed wears very much the air of resistance.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_77|“Oh, no! monseigneur, no; I only wished to be certain.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_78|“To be certain of what?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_79|“Of nothing at all, monseigneur.
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_80|“Very good. I like you better thus, monsieur,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_81|“having received no notice, I was very far from expecting it.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_82|“Because, monseigneur, there is at present in the Bastile no prisoner ill.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_83|“What do you know about that?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_84|“here is your servant, who wishes to speak with you;
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_85|“they are bringing you the doctor’s return.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_86|“let the messenger enter.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_87|“No. 12 is ill!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_88|“How was it, then,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_89|“that you told me everybody was well in your hotel, M. de Baisemeaux?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_90|“I think that there is in the article, ‘on the prisoner’s demand.’”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_91|“Yes, it is so,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_92|“But see what it is they want with you now.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_93|“What do you want now?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_94|“Can you not leave me in peace for ten minutes?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_95|“the sick man, No. 12, has commissioned the turnkey to request you to send him a confessor.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_96|“What must I answer?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_97|“Just what you please,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_98|“that is your business. I am not the governor of the Bastile.”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_99|“tell the prisoner that his request is granted.
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_100|“Oh! monseigneur, monseigneur,
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_101|“how could I have suspected! -- how could I have foreseen this!”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_102|“Who requested you to suspect, and who besought you to foresee?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_103|“The order suspects; the order knows; the order foresees -- is that not enough?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_104|“What is it you command?
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_105|“I? -- nothing at all. I am nothing but a poor priest, a simple confessor. Have I your orders to go and see the sufferer?”
7451.louisedelavalliere_67_dumas_64kb_106|“Oh, monseigneur, I do not order; I pray you to go.”
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_0|"Roger and Micah,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_1|"Yes, those were the names they used then. So, friends, I am forearmed against you, for I will step with heavy foot in your concerns by-and-by -- when I do find Master Will o' th' Green! Roger -- and Micah -- I'll not forget."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_2|"Let us seek Barnesdale forthwith,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_3|"I am all agog to warn Will o' th' Green -- for he has been a stout friend to me."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_4|"Hurry then, master,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_5|"You are not far from the Barnesdale road. In sooth, as I followed your tracks, I wondered how you had come so far within a very short space. You are now within touch of Gamewell."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_6|"Could we but find that underground path whereby cousin Geoffrey came and went from the pleasance, old friend,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_7|"why -- we might play the Yellow Lady to purpose!"
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_8|"I will undertake to bring you to the forest entrance of Master Will's castle within a score of minutes."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_9|"Lead us, Warrenton -- and I prithee be better guide than you have been so far in this adventure."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_10|"Our arrows must do duty for us, then,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_11|"Fit shafts across your bows, friends, and aim with all your hearts in it. Let not those of either side see us. 'Tis thus that our services shall be of most value to Master Will."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_12|"Choose your man, each one of you,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_13|"and soon as the soldiers issue at the charge shoot down upon your mark."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_14|"See, lording -- quick! Look how some of the enemy do creep about Master Will; they will strike him and his fellows from the rear!"
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_15|"The two who lead them are not uniformed -- like as not they are those treacherous ones whom I have such cause to remember."
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_16|"Smite them, Warrenton,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_17|"Speedily, instantly -- or they will end this fight against us. Now!"

5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_21|"Be not robbers to any who are poor and who are good fellows -- having only their poverty against them. Be kind to those who help you, but exact toll as heretofore of all who come through the greenwood. The rich to pay in money, and blood -- if it be necessary."

5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_23|"I shall live in the greenwood, Will,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_24|"with your brave men and you -- if so be I may. Have I won now the freedom of the forest?
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_25|"Upon you, Robin of Locksley, do I bestow, with this my last breath, full freedom of the forests of England,
5680.robinhood_15_creswick_64kb_26|"We will not forget your hospitality, friends all,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_0|"Remain Fitzooth, and fight your own way in the world, boy.
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_1|"When I am gone you can do what you will with the place, boy,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_2|"Never that, sir,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_3|"Let Gamewell land be ruled, for ever, by Gamewell's proper lord. I pray you to let me take counsel with my mother ere I answer you."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_4|"It is what I would suggest myself. Go to her."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_5|"Are you sure, Warrenton, that you will perform this business right carefully?
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_6|"I am part of the house of Montfichet, lording,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_7|"and it is not reasonable to think that I will turn against myself, as it were. Be sure that the horse and his trappings will be safely carried to my second master, Geoffrey, at the hour given. Do you keep the Squire employed in talk; and find excuse to lie in the little room next to his own that you may hear him if he moves."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_8|"Now to bed, boy!
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_9|"'Tis late; and I go myself within a short space. Dismiss your squire, Robin, and bid me good e'en. An early sleeper maketh a sound man."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_10|"Did I see you with Warrenton, Robin Fitzooth?
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_11|"I would fain have some talk with him on the matter of archery. I am told that this old man can draw as pretty a bow as any in Nottingham."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_12|"As any in England, I would say,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_13|"That is, in his day. Now that age is upon Warrenton and his master, cunning in such matters is to seek. Yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come. Now kiss me, boy, and keep clear head and ready hand for the joustings and games to-morrow. Good night; God keep thee, Robin."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_14|"Do you hold yourself ready, Will, so soon as the house is asleep. We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window. Rest and be still until I warn you."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_15|"are you ready?"
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_16|"Be not so foolish, friend,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_17|"Save me, masters, but you startled me rarely!
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_18|"I have but this minute left Master Montfichet, having carried his horse to him in safety. He rides into Nottingham to-morrow, unattended. I would that I might be squire to him!"
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_19|"Did you indeed bring horse and arms down this ladder, Warrenton?
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_20|"Nay, nay, lording,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_21|"This way is one of the many secret ones about Gamewell, master: but do you keep the knowledge of it to yourselves, I beg, unless you would wish hurt to our future lord of Gamewell."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_22|"Give me your hand, Warrenton, and help me to climb these steps,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_23|"'Tis dark, for all your lamp; and I fain would feel friendly assistance, such as you can give."
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_24|"Our master is to be recognized by us as the Scarlet Knight at Nottingham Fair should one ask of us, lording,
5680.robinhood_06_creswick_64kb_25|"He implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter, for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_0|"Ah, Master Robin, have you eyes for the maids already?"
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_1|"This was so sweet a lady, sir, and in some manner I do think she died. And the man shot an arrow, meaning me to see where it fell, since there would be her grave. That is what I think he meant. But then the picture was gone as quickly as it came."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_2|"Sister Nell, do you hear these marvels? Take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you. Most worthy conjurer of dreams, take up your wand again: we all are waiting impatiently to know what is in store for us!"

5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_6|"have you ever played at archery in that greenwood which your glass showed us so prettily?"
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_7|"Like as not, young master, though I am an old man."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_8|"Fie on you, friend!
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_9|"Remember that the crystal cannot lie. It tells me now that you and I will meet in rivalry, to shoot together for a strange prize -- the freedom of Sherwood!"
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_10|"What would you do?
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_11|"I can be generous, Will o' th' Green,

5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_13|"A Nottingham! A Nottingham!
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_14|"There is trouble before us. Come, Robin,
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_15|"What is the tumult and rioting?
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_16|"Which was denied us in most vile words, lording,
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_17|"Nay, we refused their request most politely, most noble,

5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_19|"I could not see my boy injured, excellence, for but doing his duty as one of Cumberland's sons. So I did push this fellow."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_20|"It is enough,
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_21|"Shame on you, citizens,
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_22|"I blush for my fellows of Nottingham. Is this how you play an English game: to force your rivals to lose to you any way? Cumberland has won my purse: the test was fairly set, and fairly were we conquered. Surely we can submit with good grace."

5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_24|"But I wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout. Else had I not gone down at the clutch, as all did see."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_25|"and it was to you that I gave another purse in consolation! Go your ways ere I cause you to be more soundly whipped than your deserts, which should bring heavy enough punishment, for sure. Come to me, men, here, here!

5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_36|"What is your name, lording?
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_37|"Robin Fitzooth."
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_38|"And mine is Will Stuteley. Shall we be comrades?"
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_39|"Right willingly, for between us we have won the battle,
5680.robinhood_04_creswick_64kb_40|"I like you, Will; you are the second Will that I have met and liked within two days; is there a sign in that?"

1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_0|“Good-night, cabby,
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_1|“Mr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_2|“Long enough to have seen you more than once. How fine it all is!”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_3|“I’m glad you think so. I like it. Won’t you join us here?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_4|“Miss Burgoyne was just telling us about a donkey-boy she had in Galway last summer,
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_5|“I thought I saw you in MacConnell’s box with Mainhall one evening, but I supposed you had left town before this.”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_6|“No, I’ve been mooning about here.”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_7|“Mooning! I see you mooning! You must be the busiest man in the world. Time and success have done well by you, you know. You’re handsomer than ever and you’ve gained a grand manner.”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_8|“Time and success have been good friends to both of us. Aren’t you tremendously pleased with yourself?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_9|“Since when have you been interested in bridges? Or have you learned to be interested in everything? And is that a part of success?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_10|“Why, how absurd! As if I were not always interested!
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_11|“Well, I think we won’t talk about bridges here, at any rate.
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_12|“But I wonder whether you’d think me impertinent if I asked you to let me come to see you sometime and tell you about them?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_13|“Why should I? Ever so many people come on Sunday afternoons.”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_14|“Nonsense. One of the pleasantest things about success is that it makes people want to look one up, if that’s what you mean. I’m like every one else — more agreeable to meet when things are going well with me. Don’t you suppose it gives me any pleasure to do something that people like?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_15|“Does it? Oh, how fine it all is, your coming on like this! But I didn’t want you to think it was because of that I wanted to see you.
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_16|“My dear Mr. Alexander, you have strange delicacies. If you please, that is exactly why you wish to see me. We understand that, do we not?”
1797.alexandersbridge_03_cather_64kb_17|“Sunday afternoon, then,
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_0|“Of course I know, Bartley,
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_1|“that after this you won’t owe me the least consideration. But we sail on Tuesday. I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you. That’s all. Good-night; I’m going now.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_2|“Sit down, Hilda; you’re wet through. Let me take off your coat — and your boots; they’re oozing water.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_3|“Here, put your feet on this stool. You don’t mean to say you walked down — and without overshoes!”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_4|“Is this the way you mean to answer it, Hilda?
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_5|“Didn’t — didn’t you mean even to say goodby to me, Bartley? Did you mean just to — quit me?
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_6|“I came to tell you that I’m willing to do as you asked me. But it’s no use talking about that now. Give me my things, please.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_7|“They never did to me.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_8|“Oh, Bartley! Did you write to me? Why didn’t you telephone me to let me know that you had? Then I wouldn’t have come.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_9|“I didn’t know it before, Hilda, on my honor I didn’t, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this. I’ve watched that door all day. I’ve jumped up if the fire crackled. I think I have felt that you were coming.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_10|“I felt that you were feeling that. But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_11|“No, you weren’t mistaken. I’ve been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone. Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_12|“What am I to do, Hilda?”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_13|“That’s what I wanted to see you about, Bartley. I’m going to do what you asked me to do when you were in London. Only I’ll do it more completely. I’m going to marry.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_14|“Oh, it doesn’t matter much! One of them. Only not Mac. I’m too fond of him.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_15|“Are you joking, Hilda?”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_16|“Indeed I’m not.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_17|“Then you don’t know what you’re talking about.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_18|“Yes, I know very well. I’ve thought about it a great deal, and I’ve quite decided. I never used to understand how women did things like that, but I know now. It’s because they can’t be at the mercy of the man they love any longer.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_19|“So it’s better to be at the mercy of a man you don’t love?”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_20|“Under such circumstances, infinitely!”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_21|“Hilda you’d better think a while longer before you do that. I don’t know what I ought to say, but I don’t believe you’d be happy; truly I don’t. Aren’t you trying to frighten me?”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_22|“No; I’m telling you what I’ve made up my mind to do. I suppose I would better do it without telling you. But afterward I shan’t have an opportunity to explain, for I shan’t be seeing you again.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_23|“I wouldn’t be so much alarmed if I didn’t know how utterly reckless you can be. Don’t do anything like that rashly.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_24|“You wouldn’t be happy. You are not that kind of woman. I’d never have another hour’s peace if I helped to make you do a thing like that.
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_25|“You see, you are different, Hilda. Don’t you know you are?
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_26|“Some women can do that sort of thing, but you — you can love as queens did, in the old time.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_27|“Only one, Bartley. Only one. And he threw it back at me a second time.”
1797.alexandersbridge_09_cather_64kb_28|“Try him again, Hilda. Try him once again.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_0|“She’s a dear, unworldly little thing,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_1|“more like the stage people of my young days — folk of simple manners. There aren’t many such left. American tours have spoiled them, I’m afraid. They have all grown very smart. Lamb wouldn’t care a great deal about many of them, I fancy.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_2|“I’m so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_3|“Yes, it’s very, very pretty. Every one at Lady Walford’s was looking at it.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_4|“I haven’t had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is. Where did you get those etchings? They’re quite unusual, aren’t they?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_5|“Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas. She is very much interested in the American artist who did them. They are all sketches made about the Villa d’Este, you see. He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_6|“It’s the air of the whole place here that I like. You haven’t got anything that doesn’t belong. Seems to me it looks particularly well to-night. And you have so many flowers. I like these little yellow irises.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_7|“Rooms always look better by lamplight — in London, at least. Though Marie is clean — really clean, as the French are. Why do you look at the flowers so critically? Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_8|“I can’t tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you. You’ve got awfully nice friends,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_9|“Those fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They don’t talk of any one else as they do of you.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_10|“is the tiniest place you have ever seen.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_11|“It’s not particularly rare,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_12|“but some of it was my mother’s. Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn’t been stowed away. We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre — queer theatres, for that matter.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_13|“I have some champagne for you, too. I don’t drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it’s poured. There is nothing else that looks so jolly.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_14|“Thank you. But I don’t like it so well as this.
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_15|“You have traveled, you say. Have you been in Paris much these late years?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_16|“Oh, yes, I go over to Paris often. There are few changes in the old Quarter. Dear old Madame Anger is dead — but perhaps you don’t remember her?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_17|“Don’t I, though! I’m so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out? I remember how she saved and scraped for him, and how he always lay abed till ten o’clock. He was the laziest fellow at the Beaux Arts; and that’s saying a good deal.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_18|“Well, he is still clever and lazy. They say he is a good architect when he will work. He’s a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever. But Angel — do you remember Angel?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_19|“Perfectly. Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_20|“How jolly it was being young, Hilda! Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris? We walked down to the Place Saint-Michel to buy some lilacs. Do you remember how sweet they smelled?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_21|“Indeed I do. Come, we’ll have our coffee in the other room, and you can smoke.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_22|“What a warm, soft spring evening that was,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_23|“and the sky, over the bridges, was just the color of the lilacs. We walked on down by the river, didn’t we?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_24|“It was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly. I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc. I was frightened at your prodigality.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_25|“God give you a happy love!
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_26|“Dear me, why did you do that? I had quite forgotten — I was back there. It was very jolly,
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_27|“Well, we are neither of us twenty now, you know. Have I told you about my new play? Mac is writing one; really for me this time. You see, I’m coming on.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_28|“I’ve seen nothing else. What kind of a part is it? Shall you wear yellow gowns? I hope so.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_29|“No, it isn’t a dress-up part. He doesn’t seem to fancy me in fine feathers. He says I ought to be minding the pigs at home, and I suppose I ought. But he’s given me some good Irish songs. Listen.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_30|“Sing ‘The Harp That Once,’ Hilda. You used to sing it so well.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_31|“Nonsense. Of course I can’t really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me. Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_32|“All the same, sing it, Hilda.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_33|“It’s really too warm in this room to sing. Don’t you feel it?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_34|“Aren’t you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck? Can’t I get a scarf or something?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_35|“Ask a theatre lady if she’s afraid of drafts!
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_36|“But perhaps, as I’m so warm — give me your handkerchief. There, just in front.
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_37|“There, that will do. It looks like a bib.
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_38|“Isn’t London a tomb on Sunday night?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_39|“It’s soft and misty. See how white the stars are.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_40|“Here, take it. You must go now, Bartley. Good-night.”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_41|“You are giving me a chance?”
1797.alexandersbridge_04_cather_64kb_42|“Yes. Take it and go. This isn’t fair, you know. Good-night.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_0|“I wish I had asked you to meet me at the office and walk home with me, Winifred. The Common is beautiful. The boys have swept the snow off the pond and are skating furiously. Did the cyclamens come?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_1|“An hour ago. What splendid ones! But aren’t you frightfully extravagant?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_2|“Not for Christmas-time. I’ll go upstairs and change my coat. I shall be down in a moment. Tell Thomas to get everything ready.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_3|“When did the azaleas get here? Thomas has got the white one in my room.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_4|“I told him to put it there.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_5|“But, I say, it’s much the finest of the lot!”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_6|“That’s why I had it put there. There is too much color in that room for a red one, you know.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_7|“It looks very splendid there, but I feel piggish to have it. However, we really spend more time there than anywhere else in the house. Will you hand me the holly?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_8|“I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from Wilson, this morning, explaining his telegram. He is coming on because an old uncle up in Vermont has conveniently died and left Wilson a little money — something like ten thousand. He’s coming on to settle up the estate. Won’t it be jolly to have him?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_9|“And how fine that he’s come into a little money. I can see him posting down State Street to the steamship offices. He will get a good many trips out of that ten thousand. What can have detained him? I expected him here for luncheon.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_10|“Those trains from Albany are always late. He’ll be along sometime this afternoon. And now, don’t you want to go upstairs and lie down for an hour? You’ve had a busy morning and I don’t want you to be tired to-night.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_11|“Hello, Wilson. What luck! Come into the library. We are to have a lot of people to dinner to-night, and Winifred’s lying down. You will excuse her, won’t you? And now what about yourself? Sit down and tell me everything.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_12|“I think I’d rather move about, if you don’t mind. I’ve been sitting in the train for a week, it seems to me.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_13|“Thank you, Wilson. She’ll be as glad to see you. Shall we have tea now? I’ll ring for Thomas to clear away this litter. Winifred says I always wreck the house when I try to do anything. Do you know, I am quite tired. Looks as if I were not used to work, doesn’t it?
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_14|“You know, I’m sailing the day after New Year’s.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_15|“Again? Why, you’ve been over twice since I was here in the spring, haven’t you?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_16|“Oh, I was in London about ten days in the summer. Went to escape the hot weather more than anything else. I shan’t be gone more than a month this time. Winifred and I have been up in Canada for most of the autumn. That Moorlock Bridge is on my back all the time. I never had so much trouble with a job before.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_17|“Haven’t I seen in the papers that there is some trouble about a tidewater bridge of yours in New Jersey?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_18|“These pink roses just came from Mrs. Hastings,
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_19|“and I am sure she meant them for you.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_20|“Have you a moment, Winifred? I have just now been thinking that this is our twelfth Christmas. Can you realize it?
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_21|“They’ve been awfully happy ones, all of them, haven’t they?
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_22|“You are happy, aren’t you Winifred? More than anything else in the world, I want you to be happy. Sometimes, of late, I’ve thought you looked as if you were troubled.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_23|“No; it’s only when you are troubled and harassed that I feel worried, Bartley. I wish you always seemed as you do to-night. But you don’t, always.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_24|“I’m growing older, my dear; that’s what you feel. Now, may I show you something? I meant to save them until to-morrow, but I want you to wear them to-night.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_25|“Where did you ever find such gold work, Bartley?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_26|“It’s old Flemish. Isn’t it fine?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_27|“They are the most beautiful things, dear. But, you know, I never wear earrings.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_28|“Yes, yes, I know. But I want you to wear them. I have always wanted you to. So few women can. There must be a good ear, to begin with, and a nose
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_29|“above reproach. Most women look silly in them. They go only with faces like yours — very, very proud, and just a little hard.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_30|“Oh, Bartley, that old foolishness about my being hard. It really hurts my feelings. But I must go down now. People are beginning to come.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_31|“Not hard to me, Winifred,
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_32|“Never, never hard to me.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_33|“that this should have happened to me!”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_34|“Here’s a note from old Wilson. He’s safe back at his grind, and says he had a bully time. ‘The memory of Mrs. Bartley will make my whole winter fragrant.’ Just like him. He will go on getting measureless satisfaction out of you by his study fire. What a man he is for looking on at life!
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_35|“This is a nasty sort of day to sail. I’ve a notion to call it off. Next week would be time enough.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_36|“That would only mean starting twice. It wouldn’t really help you out at all,
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_37|“And you’d come back late for all your engagements.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_38|“I wish things would let me rest. I’m tired of work, tired of people, tired of trailing about.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_39|“That’s what you always say, poor Bartley! At bottom you really like all these things. Can’t you remember that?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_40|“All the same, life runs smoothly enough with some people, and with me it’s always a messy sort of patchwork. It’s like the song; peace is where I am not. How can you face it all with so much fortitude?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_41|“Oh, I faced that long ago, when you were on your first bridge, up at old Allway. I knew then that your paths were not to be paths of peace, but I decided that I wanted to follow them.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_42|“Shall Edward bring down your trunks, sir?”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_43|“Yes; they are ready. Tell him not to forget the big portfolio on the study table.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_44|“It never gets any easier, Winifred.”
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_45|“I’ll work like the devil, Winifred, and be home again before you realize I’ve gone.
1797.alexandersbridge_05_cather_64kb_46|“this time I’m going to end it!”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_0|“Bog Lights.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_1|“It’s really quite the best thing MacConnell’s done,
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_2|“Why, I haven’t heard of her for — years.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_3|“Then you can’t have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It’s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she’s come up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in London — but what can one expect? Do you know, Alexander,
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_4|“do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_5|“there’s small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless hasn’t thought of me for years.
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_6|“The Rising of the Moon
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_7|“MacConnell, let me introduce Mr. Bartley Alexander. I say! It’s going famously to-night, Mac. And what an audience! You’ll never do anything like this again, mark me. A man writes to the top of his bent only once.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_8|“And have I done anything so fool as that, now?
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_9|“That’s what I was saying,
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_10|“And you’ll never bring Hilda out like this again. Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn’t possibly be better, you know.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_11|“She’ll do well enough if she keeps her pace and doesn’t go off on us in the middle of the season, as she’s more than like to do.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_12|“She’s an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that. Here comes Sir Harry Towne. He’s another who’s awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_13|“I say, Sir Harry, the little girl’s going famously to-night, isn’t she?”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_14|“Do you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to-night, for the first time. The fact is, she’s feeling rather seedy, poor child. Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself. A little attack of nerves, possibly.”
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_15|“You know Lord Westmere, of course, — the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle. Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda.”

1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_17|“No, I think not, though I am glad you ask me. You see, one can’t be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal things,
1797.alexandersbridge_02_cather_64kb_18|“oh, about those I should be very jealous. I should torture myself — I couldn’t help it.
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_0|“Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day! I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up. I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along. I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley. But why do you let me chatter on like this? Come over to the fire; you’re chilled through.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_1|“When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven’t spoken a word.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_2|“I got in about ten minutes ago. I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_3|“There’s something troubling you, Bartley. What is it?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_4|“It’s the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda. You and I.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_5|“What about us, Bartley?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_6|“I’ll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_7|“I can’t stand seeing you miserable.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_8|“I can’t live with myself any longer,
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_9|“It . . . it hasn’t always made you miserable, has it?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_10|“Always. But it’s worse now. It’s unbearable. It tortures me every minute.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_11|“I am not a man who can live two lives,
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_12|“Each life spoils the other. I get nothing but misery out of either. The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can’t get at it any more. There is this deception between me and everything.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_13|“Could you — could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_14|“It was myself I was defying, Hilda. I have thought about it until I am worn out.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_15|“When did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_16|“After the very first. The first was — sort of in play, wasn’t it?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_17|“Yes, I think it must have been. But why didn’t you tell me when you were here in the summer?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_18|“I meant to, but somehow I couldn’t. We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_19|“Yes, I was happy, wasn’t I?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_20|“Weren’t you happy then, at all?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_21|“Yes, I was then. You know. But afterward. . .”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_22|“Please tell me one thing, Bartley. At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_23|“Yes, Hilda; I know that,
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_24|“I understand, Bartley. I was wrong. But I didn’t know. You’ve only to tell me now. What must I do that I’ve not done, or what must I not do?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_25|“You want me to say it?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_26|“You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people? I can do that.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_27|“It’s got to be a clean break, Hilda. I can’t see you at all, anywhere. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_28|“Yes, I know I’m cowardly. I’m afraid of myself. I don’t trust myself any more. I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don’t dare trifle with it. It’s getting the better of me. It’s different now. I’m growing older, and you’ve got my young self here with you. It’s through him that I’ve come to wish for you all and all the time.
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_29|“Do you know what I mean?”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_30|“Oh, Bartley, what am I to do? Why didn’t you let me be angry with you? You ask me to stay away from you because you want me! And I’ve got nobody but you. I will do anything you say — but that! I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have something!”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_31|“Just something Bartley. I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness. I must see you. I must know about you. The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful — can I never make you understand what that means to me?
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_32|“Don’t cry, don’t cry,
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_33|“We’ve tortured each other enough for tonight. Forget everything except that I am here.”
1797.alexandersbridge_06_cather_64kb_34|“I think I have forgotten everything but that already,
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_0|“that looked like Alexander, but what would he be doing back there in the daycoaches?”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_1|“In July you will be in England.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_2|“I’ll have my coffee first, Philip. Have you had yours? And now, what seems to be the matter up here?”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_3|“When did you stop work?
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_4|“I haven’t stopped work yet, Mr. Alexander. I didn’t feel that I could go so far without definite authorization from you.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_5|“Then why didn’t you say in your telegram exactly what you thought, and ask for your authorization? You’d have got it quick enough.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_6|“Well, really, Mr. Alexander, I couldn’t be absolutely sure, you know, and I didn’t like to take the responsibility of making it public.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_7|“Anything I do can be made public, Phil. You say that you believe the lower chords are showing strain, and that even the workmen have been talking about it, and yet you’ve gone on adding weight.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_8|“I’m sorry, Mr. Alexander, but I had counted on your getting here yesterday. My first telegram missed you somehow. I sent one Sunday evening, to the same address, but it was returned to me.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_9|“Have you a carriage out there? I must stop to send a wire.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_10|“But just now, when there is such competition,
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_11|“And certainly that’s the new line of development.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_12|“I think you had better stop work out there at once, Dan. I should say that the lower chord here might buckle at any moment. I told the Commission that we were using higher unit stresses than any practice has established, and we’ve put the dead load at a low estimate. Theoretically it worked out well enough, but it had never actually been tried.
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_13|“Don’t look so chopfallen, Dan. It’s a jolt, but we’ve got to face it. It isn’t the end of the world, you know. Now we’ll go out and call the men off quietly. They’re already nervous, Horton tells me, and there’s no use alarming them. I’ll go with you, and we’ll send the end riveters in first.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_14|“You see that carriage over there? That’s Mrs. Alexander. They haven’t found him yet. She got off the train this morning. Horton met her. She heard it in Boston yesterday — heard the newsboys crying it in the street.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_15|“Those poor women out there, do they blame him very much?
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_16|“Don’t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton. Don’t leave me to the dread of finding out things that people may be saying. If he is blamed, if he needs any one to speak for him,
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_17|“if he needs any one, tell me, show me what to do.
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_18|“Won’t you drive up to my house, Mrs. Alexander? They will take him up there.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_19|“Take me to him now, please. I shall not make any trouble.”
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_20|“As tall as himself,
1797.alexandersbridge_10_cather_64kb_21|“will you take Mrs. Alexander the things she needs? She is going to do everything herself. Just stay about where you can hear her and go in if she wants you.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_0|“Are you busy this morning, Hilda?
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_1|“Very. I’ve been up and about three hours, working at my part. We open in February, you know.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_2|“Oh, how jolly! There, sit down at the desk. And while you are telephoning I’ll change my dress. I shan’t be long. All the morning papers are on the table.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_3|“Why don’t you wear some of those pink roses?
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_4|“But they came only this morning, and they have not even begun to open. I was saving them. I am so unconsciously thrifty!
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_5|“You’ve been sending me far too many flowers, Bartley. New ones every day. That’s too often; though I do love to open the boxes, and I take good care of them.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_6|“Why won’t you let me send you any of those jade or ivory things you are so fond of? Or pictures? I know a good deal about pictures.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_7|“No, there are some things you can’t do. There’s the carriage. Will you button my gloves for me?”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_8|“How gay your eyes are this morning, Hilda.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_9|“That’s because I’ve been studying. It always stirs me up a little.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_10|“When did you learn to take hold of your parts like that?”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_11|“When I had nothing else to think of. Come, the carriage is waiting. What a shocking while you take.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_12|“I’m in no hurry. We’ve plenty of time.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_13|“I’m not going until to-morrow, you know,
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_14|“I’ll cut off a day in Liverpool. I haven’t felt so jolly this long while.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_15|“I think people were meant to be happy, a little,
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_16|“It’s like that with us Londoners, too,
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_17|“Everything is awfully grim and cheerless, our weather and our houses and our ways of amusing ourselves. But we can be happier than anybody. We can go mad with joy, as the people do out in the fields on a fine Whitsunday. We make the most of our moment.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_18|“You are a plucky one, you.
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_19|“Yes, you are a plucky one.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_20|“No, I’m not. Not about some things, at any rate. It doesn’t take pluck to fight for one’s moment, but it takes pluck to go without — a lot. More than I have. I can’t help it,
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_21|“Seems good to get back, doesn’t it?
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_22|“London always makes me want to live more than any other city in the world. You remember our priestess mummy over in the mummy-room, and how we used to long to go and bring her out on nights like this? Three thousand years! Ugh!”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_23|“All the same, I believe she used to feel it when we stood there and watched her and wished her well. I believe she used to remember,
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_24|“I hope so. Now let’s go to some awfully jolly place for dinner before we go home. I could eat all the dinners there are in London to-night. Where shall I tell the driver? The Piccadilly Restaurant? The music’s good there.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_25|“There are too many people there whom one knows. Why not that little French place in Soho, where we went so often when you were here in the summer? I love it, and I’ve never been there with any one but you. Sometimes I go by myself, when I am particularly lonely.”
1797.alexandersbridge_07_cather_64kb_26|“Very well, the sole’s good there. How many street pianos there are about to-night! The fine weather must have thawed them out. We’ve had five miles of ‘Il Trovatore’ now. They always make me feel jaunty. Are you comfy, and not too tired?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_0|“How good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays without you. You’ve helped me over a good many Christmases.
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_1|“As if you needed me for that! But, at any rate, I needed you. How well you are looking, my dear, and how rested.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_2|“That means that I was looking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn’t it? Well, we must show wear at last, you know.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_3|“Ah, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries. I was most gently treated — as a sort of precious relic. But, do you know, it made me feel awkward to be hanging about still.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_4|“Seventy? Never mention it to me.
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_5|“You’ve got to hang about for me, you know. I can’t even let you go home again. You must stay put, now that I have you back. You’re the realest thing I have.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_6|“Dear me, am I? Out of so many conquests and the spoils of conquered cities! You’ve really missed me? Well, then, I shall hang. Even if you have at last to put ME in the mummy-room with the others. You’ll visit me often, won’t you?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_7|“Every day in the calendar. Here, your cigarettes are in this drawer, where you left them.
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_8|“But you did, after all, enjoy being at home again?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_9|“Oh, yes. I found the long railway journeys trying. People live a thousand miles apart. But I did it thoroughly; I was all over the place. It was in Boston I lingered longest.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_10|“Ah, you saw Mrs. Alexander?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_11|“I should really have liked to go up there. That was where I had my last long talk with him. But Mrs. Alexander never suggested it.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_12|“Why? Why, dear me, I don’t know. She probably never thought of it.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_13|“I don’t know what made me say that. I didn’t mean to interrupt. Go on please, and tell me how it was.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_14|“With a difference? Because of her, you mean?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_15|“Something like that, yes. Of course, as time goes on, to her he becomes more and more their simple personal relation.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_16|“You didn’t altogether like that? You felt it wasn’t wholly fair to him?”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_17|“Oh, fair enough. More than fair. Of course, I always felt that my image of him was just a little different from hers. No relation is so complete that it can hold absolutely all of a person. And I liked him just as he was; his deviations, too; the places where he didn’t square.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_18|“Has she grown much older?
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_19|“Perhaps she’s afraid of letting him out a little, of sharing him with somebody.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_20|“Yes, I know, I know. Only I can’t help being glad that there was something for him even in stupid and vulgar people. My little Marie worshiped him. When she is dusting I always know when she has come to his picture.”
1797.alexandersbridge_11_cather_64kb_21|“nothing can happen to one after Bartley.”

2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_2|“No, I'm only tired, had a good deal to do lately, and the dull weather makes me just a trifle blue. I shall soon brighten up when I get to my work again,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_3|“You don't look a bit natural. What have you been doing to your precious little self?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_4|“I'm all right enough, as you'll see when I'm in order. I'm proper glad to find you looking so well and happy. Does all go smoothly, Fan?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_5|“Answer me one question first,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_6|“Tell me, truly, have you never repented of your hint to Sydney?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_7|“On your honor, as an honest girl?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_8|“On my honor, as anything you please. Why do you suspect me of it?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_9|“Because something is wrong with you. It's no use to deny it, for you 've got the look I used to see in that very glass on my own face when I thought he cared for you. Forgive me, Polly, but I can't help saying it, for it is there, and I want to be as true to you as you were to me if I can.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_10|“I tell you I don't love him! If he was the only man in the world, I would n't marry him, because I don't want to.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_11|“Then if it's not him, it's some one else. You've got a secret, Polly, and I should think you might tell it, as you know mine,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_12|“My precious Polly, do I know him?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_13|“And is he very wise, good, and splendid, dear?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_14|“He ought to be if you love him. I hope he is n't bad?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_15|“I'm suited, that's enough.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_16|“Oh, please just tell me one thing more. Don't he love back again?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_17|“No. Now don't say another word, I can't bear it!
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_18|“Thank heaven for that!

2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_23|“Polly, is it Tom?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_18_alcott_64kb_24|“Oh, Polly, I am so glad! I never thought of it you are so good, and he 's such a wild boy, I can't believe it but it is so dear of you to care for him.”

2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_51|“Nothing particular. Trix treats Tom shamefully, and he bears it like a lamb. I tell him to break his engagement, and not be worried so; but he won't, because she has been jilted once and he thinks it's such a mean thing to do.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_52|“Perhaps she'll jilt him.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_53|“I've no doubt she will, if anything better comes along. But Trix is getting passe, and I should n't wonder if she kept him to his word, just out of perversity, if nothing else.”

2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_58|“Pretty well, but she worries me by her queer tastes and notions. She loves to go into the kitchen and mess, she hates to study, and said right before the Vincents that she should think it would be great fun to be a beggar-girl, to go round with a basket, it must be so interesting to see what you'd get.”

2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_64|“I'm not blind, my dear, neither is Tom, and when a young gentleman cuts a call abruptly short, and races after a young lady, and is seen holding her hand at the quietest corner of the park, and then goes travelling all of a sudden, we know what it means if you don't.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_65|“Who got up that nice idea, I should like to know?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_66|“Now don't be affected, Polly, but just tell me, like a dear, has n't he proposed?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_67|“No, he has n't.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_68|“Don't you think he means to?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_69|“I don't think he'll ever say a word to me.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_70|“Well, I am surprised!
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_71|“But don't you love him, Polly?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_72|“Don't you think he cared for you, dear?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_73|“I don't mean to be prying, but I really thought he did.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_74|“That's not for me to say, but if it is so, it's only a passing fancy and he'll soon get over it.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_75|“Do tell me all about it; I'm so interested, and I know something has happened, I hear it in your voice, for I can't see your face.”

2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_77|“No, he would n't; He'd like it and respect you for doing it. But, Polly, it would have been a grand thing for you.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_78|“I can't sell myself for an establishment.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_79|“Mercy! What an idea!”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_80|“Well, that's the plain English of half your fashionable matches. I 'm'odd,' you know, and prefer to be an independent spinster and teach music all my days.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_14_alcott_64kb_81|“Ah, but you won't. You were made for a nice, happy home of your own, and I hope you'll get it, Polly, dear,

2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_48|“It was so funny to see you working away, and never guessing who the cake was for. I perfectly trembled every time you opened your mouth, for fear you'd ask some question about it. That was the reason Polly preached and I kept talking when she was gone.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_49|“Very stupid of me; but I forgot all about to-day. Suppose we cut it; I don't seem to care for anything else,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_50|“I hope the plums won't all be at the bottom,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_51|“I've had a good many at the top already, you know,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_52|“Plums all through; I'm glad I had a hand in it, but Polly deserves the credit, and must wear the posy,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_53|“Do run! I'm perfectly fainting to know what the matter is,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_54|“He don't want me; besides, I could n't say a word for myself if that letter was from Sydney,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_55|“Did you want me, Tom?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_56|“Yes. Come in, please, and don't look scared; I only want to show you a present I've had, and ask your advice about accepting it.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_57|“Why, Tom, you look as if you had been knocked down!
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_58|“I have; regularly floored; but I'm up again, and steadier than ever. Just you read that, and tell me what you think of it.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_59|“I think she is a mercenary, heartless, ungrateful girl! That's what I think.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_60|“Oh, the deuce! I did n't mean to show that one; it's the other.
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_61|“I don't care, though; every one will know to-morrow; and perhaps you'll be good enough to keep the girls from bothering me with questions and gabble,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_62|“I don't wonder you looked upset. If the other letter is as bad, I'd better have a chair before I read it,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_63|“It's a million times better, but it knocked me worse than the other; kindness always does.
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_64|“Whenever I was in a quandary, I used to go and consult grandma, and she always had something sensible or comfortable to say to me. She's gone now, but somehow, Polly, you seem to take her place. Would you mind sitting in her chair, and letting me tell you two or three things, as Will does?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_65|“If I can help you, let me.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_66|“I'll do my best, but I can't fill grandma's place, or give you any wise, good advice. I wish I could!”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_67|“Oh, Tom, that's a birthday present worth having, for it's so beautifully given I don't see how you can refuse it. Arthur Sydney is a real nobleman!
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_68|“So he is! I don't know another man living, except father, who would have done such a thing, or who I could bring myself to take it from. Do you see, he's not only paid the confounded debts, but has done it in my name, to spare me all he could?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_69|“I see, it's like him; and I think he must be very happy to be able to do such a thing.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_70|“It is an immense weight off my shoulders, for some of those men could n't afford to wait till I'd begged, borrowed, or earned the money. Sydney can wait, but he won't long, if I know myself.
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_71|“You won't take it as a gift, then?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_72|“Then don't think I will. I'm a pretty poor affair, Polly, but I'm not mean enough to do that, while I've got a conscience and a pair of hands.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_73|“What will you do, Tom?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_74|“I'll tell you; may I sit here?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_75|“I've had so many plans in my head lately, that sometimes it seems as if it would split,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_76|“I've thought seriously of going to California, Australia, or some out-of-the-way place, where men get rich in a hurry.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_77|“It would be hard on mother and the girls, I suppose; besides, I don't quite like it myself; looks as if I shirked and ran away.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_78|“Not a bit, and I quite agree with you.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_79|“If you really mean work, I know you could,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_80|“I wish you could be with Ned; you'd get on together, I'm sure; and he'd be so glad to do anything he could. I'll write and ask, straight away, if you want me to.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_81|“Suppose you do; just for information, you know, then I shall have something to go upon. I want to have a feasible plan all ready, before I speak to father. There's nothing so convincing to business men as facts, you know.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_82|“That will be wise. Do you think your father will like this plan?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_83|“Pretty sure he will. Yesterday, when I told him I must go at something right off, he said, 'Anything honest, Tom, and don't forget that your father began the world as a shop-boy.' You knew that, did n't you?”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_84|“Yes, he told me the story once, and I always liked to hear it, because it was pleasant to see how well he had succeeded.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_85|“I'm so glad to hear you say that, Tom! I've sometimes thought you did n't quite appreciate your father, any more than he knew how much of a man you were.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_86|“Never was till to-day, you know,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_87|“Odd, is n't it, how people live together ever so long, and don't seem to find one another out, till something comes to do it for them. Perhaps this smash-up was sent to introduce me to my own father.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_88|“There's philosophy for you,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_89|“Did this surprise you?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_90|“Well, it did me; for you know as soon as we came to grief I offered to release Trix from the engagement, and she would n't let me,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_91|“That surprised me,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_92|“So it did me, for Fan always insisted it was the money and not the man she cared for. Her first answer pleased me very much, for I did not expect it, and nothing touches a fellow more than to have a woman stand by him through thick and thin.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_93|“She don't seem to have done it.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_94|“Well, he is n't going!
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_95|“Came within an ace of it,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_96|“It never rains but it pours, 'specially in hard times, but when a man is down, a rap or two more don't matter much, I suppose. It's the first blow that hurts most.”
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_97|“Glad to see you take the last blow so well.
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_98|“That's very good of you, quite Sydneyesque, and noble,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_99|“It will be all plain sailing for Syd, I fancy,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_100|“He deserves the very best of everything, and I pray the Lord he may get it,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_101|“You'll write to Ned to-morrow, will you? I'll take anything he's got, for I want to be off,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_102|“I'll write to-night. Would you like me to tell the girls about Trix and Sydney?
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_103|“I wish you would. I don't know how to thank you for all you've done for me; I wish to heaven I did,
2163.oldfashionedgirl_17_alcott_64kb_104|“I beg pardon could n't help it grandma always let me on my birthday.”
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_0|"Can you send copy last prescription? Lost it. Face red as a carrot. In agonies! What shall I do? Help!"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_1|"Stick your feet in hot water. Go to bed at once. Prescription sent by post. Take it every hour."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_2|"Not by no manner of means."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_3|"Buy the horse at any price. He's a spanker. Let the pigs go for what they'll fetch."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_4|"I beg your pardon. The sleet drivin' in my face prevented my seeing you. You're not hurt I hope."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_5|"No, Mr Flint, you haven't hurt me,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_6|"Why, it's you, Miss May! Now isn't that good luck, my turnin' up just in the nick o' time to see you home? Here, catch hold of my arm. The wind's fit to tear the lamp-posts up by the roots."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_7|"But this is not the way home,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_8|"That's true, Miss May, it ain't, but I'm only goin' round a bit by St. Paul's Churchyard. There's a shop there where they sell the sausages my old 'ooman's so fond of. It don't add more than a few yards to the road home."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_9|"There's a present for you, old 'ooman,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_10|"just let me catch hold of a fryin'-pan and I'll give you to understand what a blow-out means."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_11|"You're a good laddie, Sol,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_12|"Ye'll be wat, lassie,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_13|"I'm not wet, only a little damp."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_14|"Change your feet, lassie, direc'ly, or you'll tak' cauld,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_15|"what news have you for me to-night?"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_16|"Deed, May, there's little but the auld story -- Mercies, mornin', noon, and night. But, oo ay, I was maist forgettin'; Miss Lillycrap was here, an left ye a message o' some sort."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_17|"And what was the message, Grannie?"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_18|"She's gone and forgot it,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_19|"You've no chance of getting it now, Miss May, for I've noticed that when the old 'ooman once forgets a thing it don't come back to her -- except, p'r'aps, a week or two afterwards. Come now, draw in and go to work. But, p'r'aps, Dollops may have heard the message. Hallo! Dollops! come here, and bring the kettle with you."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_20|"Did you see Miss Lillycrop, Dollops?
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_21|"Yes, sir, I did; I saw'd 'er a-goin' hout."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_22|"Did you hear her leave a message?"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_23|"Yes, sir, I did. I 'eard 'er say to missis, `Be sure that you give May Maylands my love, an tell 'er wotever she do to keep 'er feet dry, an' don't forgit the message, an' say I'm so glad about it, though it's not much to speak of arter all!'"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_24|"What was she so glad about?
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_25|"Pooh! be off to your pots an' pans, child,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_26|"You can't remember it, I s'pose, eh?"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_27|"That's right, old 'ooman,
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_28|"heap up the coals, mayhap it'll revive the memory."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_29|"it wasn't a message, it was a letter!"
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_30|"DEAREST MAY, -- I've been to see my friend `in power,' and he says it's `all right,' that you've only to get your brother over as soon as possible, and he'll see to getting him a situation. The enclosed paper is for his and your guidance. Excuse haste. -- Your affectionate coz, SARAH LILLYCROP."
8566.posthaste_02_ballantyne_64kb_31|"Let Phil come here at once. The application has been successful. Never mind clothes. Everything arranged. Best love to all."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_0|"Isn't it a grand sight?
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_1|"Glorious! I never look upon that sight,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_2|"without wishing that I had lived in the days of the old Vikings."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_3|"Sure, they were a wild lot, after all?
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_4|"Of course they were, Phil,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_5|"You don't mean that?
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_6|"Yes, I do mean that,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_7|"If the Norsemen of old did mischief, as no one can deny, they were undoubtedly grand old scoundrels, and it is certain that they did much good to the world, whether they meant it or not."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_8|"It's thinking I am, what I wouldn't give if my legs were only as long as yours, George."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_9|"That they will soon be,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_10|"if they go on at the rate they've been growing of late."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_11|"and though they can't grow long, they never stop short in the race of life. Why, look at Nelson -- he was short; and Wellington wasn't long, and Bonny himself was small in every way except in his intellect -- who's that coming up the hill?"
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_12|"It's Mike Kenny, the postman, I think. I wonder if he has brought a letter from sister May. Mother expects one, I know."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_13|"Any letters for me to-night?"
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_14|"No, sur, not wan,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_15|"but I've left wan at Rocky Cottage,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_16|"Was it May's handwriting?
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_17|"Sure I don't know for sartin whose hand it is i' the inside, but it's not Miss May's on the cover. Niver a wan in these parts could write like her -- copperplate, no less."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_18|"Come, George, let's go back,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_19|"we've been looking out for a letter for some days past."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_20|"It's not exactly a letter, Master Phil,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_21|"Ah, then, she'd never put us off with a newspaper,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_22|"No, it's a telegram,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_23|"that's strange. Are ye sure, Mike?"
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_24|"No, sur, I thank ye,
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_25|"What! ye haven't taken the pledge, have ye?
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_26|"No, sur; but I've had three glasses already on me walk, an' that's as much as I can rightly carry."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_27|"Nonsense, Mike. You've a stiff climb before you -- here, take it off."
8566.posthaste_01_ballantyne_64kb_28|"Have a dhrop, Phil?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_0|"Come with me, child,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_1|"and spend a week at The Rosebud."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_2|"Impossible, dear Maria,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_3|"Put 'em off. Fulfil 'em when you come back. At all events,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_4|"come for a night or two."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_5|"Come now, Lilly
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_6|"but give me no buts. You know that you've no good reason for refusing."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_7|"Indeed I have,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_8|"What, the infant who opened the door to me?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_9|"Yes, Tottie Bones; she is obliged to stay at nights with me just now, owing to her mother, poor thing, being under the necessity of shutting up her house while she goes to look after a drunken husband, who has forsaken her."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_10|"I wonder why women marry!"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_11|"Don't you think it's a sort of -- of -- unavoidable necessity?
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_12|"Not at all, my dear, not at all. I have avoided it. So have you. If I had my way, I'd put a stop to marriage altogether, and bring this miserable world to an abrupt close. -- But little Bones is no difficulty: we'll take her along with us."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_13|"Well, what further objections, Lilly?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_14|"What! one baby in charge of another?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_15|"Indeed it is too true; and, you know, you couldn't stand a baby."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_16|"How d'you know that? Let me see it."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_17|"Ha! I suppose little Bones is behind it,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_18|"Set the baby down, child, and let me see you."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_19|"What is your age, little Bones?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_20|"Just turned six, m'm,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_21|"You're sixty-six, at the least, compared with male creatures of the same age,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_22|"Have you a bonnet and shawl, little Bones?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_23|"Go and put 'em on then, and get that thing also ready to go out."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_24|"He's a very good bybie
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_25|"on'y rather self-willed at times, m'm,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_26|"Just so. True to your woman's nature. Always ready to apologise for the male monster that tyrannises over you. I suppose, now, you'd say that your drunken father was a good man?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_27|"Indeed I would, m'm. Oh! you've no notion 'ow kind father is w'en 'e's not in liquor."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_28|"There, there. Of course he is. I didn't mean to say he wasn't, little Bones. It's a curious fact that many drun -- , I mean people given to drink, are kind and amiable. It's a disease. Go now, and get your things on, and do you likewise, Lilly. My cab is at the door. Be quick."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_29|"Charing Cross, -- you idiot."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_30|"Stay here, Lilly, with the baby. -- Jump out, little Bones. Come with me."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_31|"What kind of hat, ma'am?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_32|"suitable for this child -- only see that it's not a doll's hat. Let it fit her."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_33|"She only wants wings and washing to make her an angel,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_34|"Oh, bybie! it's 'eaven upon earth, ain't it, darling?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_35|"That's right, darling. Ain't it fun? And such flowers too -- oh! all for nothing, only got to pull 'em. Yes, roll away, darling, you can't dirty yourself 'ere. Come, I shall 'ave a roll too.
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_36|"Where, and when, and why did you find that child?
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_37|"It is indeed strange,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_38|"Because she has a bad affection of the lungs. If she were under more favourable circumstances she might recover."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_39|"Pooh! nonsense. People constantly recover from what is called bad affection of the lungs. Can nothing be done for her?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_40|"Little Tottie must be rescued, you know, and I have set my heart on doing it."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_41|"You'll do nothing of the sort,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_42|"No, you shan't rescue her,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_43|"you've got all London at your feet, and there's plenty more where that one came from. Come, Lilly, you mustn't be greedy. You may have the baby if you like, but you must leave little Bones to me."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_44|"If you please, m'm, I can't eat any more,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_45|"Can't eat more, child? -- try,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_46|"Come, Tot, you and I shall go out for a walk."
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_47|"Now, Tot, tell father all about your visit to Miss Stivergill. She's very rich -- eh?"
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_48|"Oh! awfully,
8566.posthaste_12_ballantyne_64kb_49|"Keeps a carriage -- eh?"

6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_12|'especially as there is nothing to eat. Perhaps we shall find another house.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_13|'We'll go in here,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_14|'No, no; I am afraid!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_15|'We shall be attacked and killed! It is a robbers
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_16|'Yes, it looks like it; but we can't help that,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_17|'We have had nothing to eat for hours, and I'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_18|'And there's going to be a storm,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_19|'Well, this looks nice,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_20|'You get into bed, mother,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_21|'and I'll lie down by the side. Don't be alarmed; you can sleep quite safely till the morning.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_22|'First I'll go out into the forest and see if I can find our road,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_23|'Yes, if you will promise me two things,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_24|'first that you will take me home to your country and let me be crowned king instead of your son; and secondly, that you will kill him in case he should try to take the throne from me -- if you will not agree to this I shall kill you.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_25|'Kill my own son!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_26|'You need not do that exactly,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_27|'When he returns, just lie on the bed and say that you have been taken ill, and add that you have dreamed that in a forest, a mile away, there are some beautiful apples. If you could only get some of these you would be well again, but if not you will die.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_28|'I have been through the forest and found the road, so we will start directly we have had some breakfast.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_29|'Oh, I feel so ill!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_30|'I could not walk a single step; and there is only one thing that will cure me.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_31|'What is that?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_32|'I dreamed,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_33|'that, a mile away, there is a forest where the most beautiful apples grow, and if I could have some of them I should soon be well again.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_34|'Oh! but dreams don't mean anything,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_35|'There is a magician who lives near here. I'll go to him and ask for a spell to cure you.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_36|'My dreams always mean something,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_37|'If I don't get any apples I shall die.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_38|'Well, I'll go,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_39|'But I really must have some breakfast first; I shall walk all the faster.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_40|'If you do not hurry you will find me dead when you come back,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_41|'It is no use after all, I can't get up there,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_42|'What am I to do now?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_43|'What do you want, little dog?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_44|'Come along in with me.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_45|'I may as well go and see what is in there,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_46|'it's worth something to have a sword like that.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_47|'What evil fate brought you here?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_48|'It isn't much use for me to tell you lest my lot becomes yours.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_49|'I am not afraid of that. Tell me who you are and what has brought you here,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_50|'My story is not long,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_51|'I am a princess from Arabia, and twelve robbers who dwell in this place are fighting among themselves as to which shall have me to wife.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_52|'Shall I save you?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_53|'Yes; but you can't do it. To begin with, how could you break the chain I am bound with?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_54|'Oh, that's easy enough,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_55|'No, I dare not!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_56|'If we should meet the robbers in the passage they would kill us both.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_57|'But how long have you been here?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_58|'About twenty years, I think,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_59|'Twenty years!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_60|'Then you had better shut your eyes, for when you have been sitting there so long it might hurt you to go too suddenly into the daylight. So you are the Princess of Arabia, whose beauty is famous throughout all the world! I, too, am a prince.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_61|'Will you not come back to Arabia and marry me, now you have saved my life?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_62|'Even if my father is living still, he must be old, and after his death you can be king.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_63|'I cannot do that -- I must live and die in my own country. But at the end of a year I will follow you and marry you.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_64|'I will die before I part from it,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_65|'And if at the end of a year I am still living, I will come. I believe I have heard that at the other side of this forest there is a port from which ships sail to Arabia. Let us hasten there at once.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_66|'I wish he were here now. A year is a long time.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_67|'That is a strange fellow! If he had gone into the forest the wild beasts must have eaten him unless he has a powerful charm to protect him. If that is so we must get it away from him.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_68|'No, he has nothing,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_69|'We must think of a way to get it,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_70|'When he comes in say you are well again, and have some food ready for him. Then, whilst he is eating, tell him you dreamed that he was attacked by wild beasts, and ask him how he managed to escape from them. After he has told you I can easily find a way to take his charm from him.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_71|'Here are your apples. Now you will soon be well again, and ready to come away with me.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_72|'Oh, I am better already,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_73|'And see, your dinner is all hot for you, eat it up, and then we will start.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_74|'I had a horrible dream while you were away. I saw you in a forest full of wild animals, and they were running round you and growling fiercely. How did you manage to escape from them?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_75|'Oh, it was only a dream!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_76|'But my dreams are always true,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_77|'Tell me how it was.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_78|'One should tell one's mother everything,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_79|'See, mother, here are a sword and a mail shirt which I found in the first house we entered in the forest, and as long as I carry them nothing can hurt me. That is what saved me from the wild beasts.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_80|'How can I be thankful enough!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_81|'Drink this, to please me,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_82|'It will do you good after all you've gone through, and make you sleep well.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_83|'What an odd taste it has!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_84|'These things belong to my brother,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_85|'I am the master now,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_86|'Choose one of two things -- either you must die, or your eyes will be put out, and you will be sent back to the forest.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_87|'Is this your doing?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_88|'"whilst there is life there is hope." I will go back to the forest.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_89|'we will return to your country.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_90|'Why, here is a poor blind fellow!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_91|'No doubt that is the work of the robbers. Let us take him to Arabia with us. Would you like to come, my good man?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_92|'Why, it is the princess's ring!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_93|'Where did it come from?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_94|'It fell off a blind man's finger,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_95|'He must have stolen it; but I dare say you will be able to return it to the princess.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_96|'It is the ring I gave my betrothed!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_97|'Take me to him at once.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_98|'At last you have come! The year is over, and I thought you were dead. Now we will be married immediately.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_99|'I cannot have a blind person to succeed me,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_100|'It is perfectly absurd!'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_101|'Do you know that it is Midsummer-eve to-night?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_102|'And do you know that part of the garden which is known as the Queen's Bed?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_103|'Well, perhaps you don't know this, that whoever has bad eyes, or no eyes at all, should bathe his eye-sockets in the dew that falls there to-night, because then he will get his sight back. Only he must do it between twelve and one o'clock.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_104|'I can see you!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_105|'I don't believe it,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_106|'Well, go and hang your handkerchief on a bush, and if I find it at once you must believe me,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_107|'Yes, indeed, you can see,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_108|'To think that my mother's bed has really given back your sight!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_109|'I'll join you, if I may,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_110|'The more the merrier.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_111|'Where are you going, my masters?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_112|'Then come and serve me,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_113|'there will be plenty to eat and drink, and not much work to do, and if, at the end of a year, you can answer three questions, I'll give you each a sack of gold. Otherwise you must be turned into beasts.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_114|'You will find all that you want here,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_115|'and all you need do is to take care of the house, for I am going away, and shall only return when the year is over.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_116|'To-morrow,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_117|'the year is up.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_118|'And what questions will you ask?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_119|'First I shall ask how long they have been here -- they don't know, the young fools! Secondly I shall ask what shines on the roof of the castle.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_120|'The lamp that was stolen by me from the princess as she slept in the garden.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_121|'And what is the third question?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_122|'I shall ask where the food and drink they consume every day come from. I steal it from the king's table; but they don't know that.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_123|'Now I shall ask my questions,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_124|'To begin with: How long have you been here?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_125|'What is it that shines on the roof?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_126|'The sun -- the moon.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_127|'May I answer?
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_128|'Yes, certainly,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_129|'The lamp that you stole from the princess whilst she was asleep in the garden.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_130|'Where does the meat and drink you have had here come from?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_131|'Yes, if you can,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_132|'It comes from the king's table,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_133|'No, we haven't any,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_134|'Has your lordship a piece of money for a poor man?

6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_137|'The things are all beautiful!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_138|'How much would you take for them?'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_139|'Name your own price, your majesty,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_140|'I really don't know what to say,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_141|'Wait till my husband comes back -- men understand such things better; and then, as you are a stranger, he would like to chat with you a little.
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_142|'Come and see all these lovely gold saucepans!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_143|'Perhaps, now you know me, mother,
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_144|'you had better repent for all the wrong you have done me, or your life will be short.'
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_145|'Oh, have mercy!
6056.olivefairybook_23_lang_64kb_146|'I could not help it. I was so frightened.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_0|'With all my heart,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_1|'but what shall we talk about? A city man like you will not care to hear about cattle and crops.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_2|'I'll tell you what we will do. We will each tell the other the wildest tale we can imagine, and he who first throws doubt on the other's story shall pay him a hundred rupees.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_3|'I've seen that kind of thing myself.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_4|'No less than one hundred and one camels,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_5|'Amazing, the strength of that kite!
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_6|'But -- well -- yes, doubtless; yes -- well -- one hundred and one camels -- and what did he do with them?'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_7|'it's so painful having anything in one's eye.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_8|'the princess shook her head, and sprang up, clapping her hand on her eye. "Oh dear!" she cried, "I've got something in my eye, and how it does smart!"'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_9|'It always does,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_10|'perfectly true. Well, what did the poor thing do?'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_11|'and then she just twisted up the corner of her headcloth and fished a hundred more of them out of the princess's eye, and popped them all into her pocket with the other.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_12|'I can't think of anything more now,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_13|'Besides, that is the end; what do you say to it?'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_14|'and no doubt perfectly true!'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_15|'Well, it is your turn,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_16|'I am so anxious to hear your story. I am sure it will be very interesting.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_17|'Yes, I think it will,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_18|'My father was a very prosperous man. Five cows he had, and three yoke of oxen, and half a dozen buffaloes, and goats in abundance; but of all his possessions the thing he loved best was a mare. A well bred mare she was -- oh, a very fine mare!'

6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_20|'and you know how, in June, the air is full of dust-storms with rain at times? Well, the poor beast got dust in that wound, and what's more, with the dust some grains of wheat, and, what with the dust and the heat and the wet, that wheat sprouted and began to grow!'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_21|'Wheat does when it gets a fair chance,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_22|'Yes; and the next thing we knew was that there was a crop of wheat on that horse's back as big as anything you ever saw in a hundred-acre field, and we had to hire twenty men to reap it!'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_23|'One generally has to hire extra hands for reaping,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_24|'And we got four hundred maunds of wheat off that mare's back!

6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_27|'"Certainly, neighbour," answered my father; "take what you need, and repay it as you can."'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_28|'Well, he took the wheat away with him,
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_29|'but he never repaid it, and it's a debt to this day. Sometimes I wonder whether I shall not go to law about it.'
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_30|'What is the matter?
6056.olivefairybook_05_lang_64kb_31|'The wheat is the cheaper; I'll pay you for the wheat,

7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_0|“What can be the matter with her?
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_1|“Can I find out? Is there any way in which I can comfort her? I wish mother were here. There is no doubt she is carrying a terrible heavy burden, and she won’t let anyone help her. What did that letter mean?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_2|“I can’t stand it.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_3|“God will give you strength, dear,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_4|“She won’t let me comfort her, and it is dreadful to see that dull look of agony and suffering in her eyes,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_5|“you will be sure to be ready to go with me to East Hall this evening?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_6|“She heard what Miss Penrose said,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_7|“I noticed that she was standing by the door when the principal sounded the gong.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_8|“All the same, she does not always hear what is said,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_9|“She lives in a wonderful and strange world of her own. I often doubt if she notices what goes on around her.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_10|“Well, then, you had better remind her. By the way, do you object to us also coming with you to East Hall this evening?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_11|“I shall be very glad,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_12|“I have not seen much of Miss Lauderdale yet, and am most anxious to hear her speak to-night. I wonder what she can want with us all?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_13|“Well, there is no good in guessing,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_14|“and besides it only wastes time. What do you mean to do this afternoon, Miss Gilroy?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_15|“I have not made any special plans.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_16|“Well then, won’t you come out on the water with us. You have passed your swimming test, so it is all right. Belle Acheson will be with us; we should like you to know her.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_17|“We ought to be ready to start for East Hall at 8.25,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_18|“You will be quite ready then, won’t you, Annie dear? I’ll put out your dress, and leave everything quite nice and neat for you.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_19|“I do wish, Leslie Gilroy, you would not worry me.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_20|“I don’t mean to worry you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_21|“Of course if you really feel that I worry you, I had better leave you alone.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_22|“I shall go by and by,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_23|“Ah! thank goodness you are going,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_24|“Don’t you think, Annie, you are a little unkind to me?
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_25|“Oh, what does a little unkindness matter?
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_26|“Do you mind, as you are leaving the room, shutting that window. I have been enduring the tortures of a draught for the last hour, and have lately been suffering from neuralgia.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_27|“Oh, you poor thing,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_28|“why did you not tell me so, or,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_29|“why did you not shut your own window?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_30|“Because I require fresh air,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_31|“The Chetwynds say you are coming boating with us?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_32|“And Belle Acheson is to be one of the party,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_33|“I think it well to tell you; you must be prepared for a very peculiar person. But you look worried, Miss Gilroy; is anything wrong?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_34|“I am a little anxious about Annie Colchester.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_35|“That queer, red-haired girl? I saw her in chapel on Sunday.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_36|“There are many fine points about her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_37|“but I don’t think she is quite well, and I wish she would not work so hard. However, I won’t think of her now. I cannot do anything to help her just at present, and I mean to enjoy myself.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_38|“Then had not you better come down to the quay. I told the other girls I would bring you. The boat we are to have this afternoon is the Merry Alice. Did you pass your swimming test well?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_39|“I passed it last week, and was crowned with honors,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_40|“This is our great friend, Miss Gilroy,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_41|“Come on in front, please; I have something I specially wish to say to you on the subject of a life of absolute devotion. Those great truths which ought to agitate the souls of each man and woman worthy of the name have been specially borne in upon me during the last few hours. I have just been reading a passage which I should be glad to repeat to you.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_42|“There’s a slap in the face,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_43|“and to you, too, Miss Gilroy. Did I not tell you she was an oddity.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_44|“don’t laugh at poor Belle; don’t prejudice Miss Gilroy against her. If everybody else was quite as earnest and sincere, what a different world it would be!”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_45|“What an appalling world it would be!
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_46|“it would not be endurable.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_47|“I have submitted for one hour, under protest.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_48|“I don’t quite understand you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_49|“I shall certainly aim for the full life,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_50|“Whether I succeed or not remains to be proved.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_51|“I beg your pardon,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_52|“but really, Belle Acheson, you are too absurd for anything.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_53|“I know you mean kindly, Miss Acheson,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_54|“but how can you know, as you have never seen me before, whether mine is an earnest character or not?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_55|“Ah, you little guess my capacity,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_56|“Yes; it would be very bad,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_57|“What a mercy she is not steering,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_58|“We should all be in that bindweed at the other side of the river by now.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_59|“Belle, dear,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_60|“do, please, come down from the clouds. We were so anxious to introduce you to Miss Gilroy, and I am afraid you are frightening her. Don’t be quite so — so outré during your first interview.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_61|“Miss Gilroy, whatever happens, I cannot but be myself.
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_62|“Let us quote from Longfellow now; it would be most appropriate,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_63|“I am sorry that you have interrupted me with that very silly remark. As to the young person in the stern, I refuse to acknowledge her existence; but you, Marjorie, are laughing at me.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_64|“I am sure you mean very well, indeed, and in some ways I agree with you. I also want to lead the earnest life.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_65|“Do you? Is that a fact? Tell me how you furnish your room?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_66|“But I cannot imagine what that has to do with it,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_67|“A vast deal, for it shows the real inclination of the soul. Is the soul going to steep itself in luxury, or is it going to cast away all hindrances, and run its race in fullness, in power? Is it to be clogged and hindered? Speak; don’t keep me in suspense. How have you furnished your room?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_68|“My half-room — I only possess half a room — was furnished for me by the governors of the college,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_69|“It is true that I have added a few things, for I like pretty rooms. I like to look nice myself. My mother has always taught me to pay a great deal of attention to personal appearance.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_70|“Have you nothing more to say, Belle?
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_71|“I am disappointed.
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_72|“What a blessing for you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_73|“But I am really sorry for her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_74|“She is full of earnestness; but she goes too far.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_75|“For goodness’ sake, don’t let her hear you. Her eyes are closed for the present, and she is only muttering to herself. What a comfort if she remains in that state for the rest of our row!”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_76|“what are you doing now? You are saying something; what is it?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_77|“When my nerves are ruffled, I always find that recitation is the greatest help to me,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_78|“I am reciting at the present moment a poem from one of our great writers. The frivolous fact that I am out on the water, being rowed by you and Eileen, that I am wasting some of the precious hours of a golden day, must be counteracted as far as possible. But stay; would you two girls,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_79|“would you two like me to recite aloud the poem in question?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_80|“Oh, for goodness’ sake, no!
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_81|“that would be quite the last straw.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_82|“that the remark of the young person who holds the tiller-ropes ought to be considered. What do you two say?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_83|“Of course Eileen and I would like it very much,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_84|“but Leslie is our guest, and we must consult her.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_85|“She would not appreciate,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_86|“but perhaps, as you say, she is your guest. Well, I submit. My disappointment has been deep with regard to Miss Gilroy.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_87|“Whether you are disappointed in me or not, please try to enlighten me by your recitation,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_88|“for I should enjoy it of all things.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_89|“‘Either Truth, Goodness, Virtue are not still The self-same which they are, and always one, But alter to the project of our will; Or we our actions make them wait upon, Putting them in the livery of our skill, And cast them off again when we have done.’”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_90|“For goodness’ sake, sit still, or we’ll be upset,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_91|“In addition to poetry of the Middle Ages, a ducking is more than I am prepared for.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_92|“‘And for the few that only lend their ear, That few is all the world; which with a few Do ever live, and move, and work, and stir. This is the heart doth feel, and only know; The rest of all that only bodies bear, Roll up and down, and fill up but the row.’”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_93|“Very fine, indeed,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_94|“and I quite see the allusion to myself. I am one of those who but a body bear, roll up and down, and fill up but the row.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_95|“Notwithstanding the disappointment you gave me with regard to your room,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_96|“I have not the slightest doubt that you understand what Musophilus alludes to?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_97|“To a certain extent, yes,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_98|“I believe I shall win you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_99|“Come to my room to-morrow; I shall see you alone. Don’t fail to be with me between half-past two and three.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_100|“Oh, how could you?
7233.girlsofstwodes_17_meade_64kb_101|“I pity you from my soul; you have done for yourself now.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_0|“had you not better wrap a shawl about you; it is time to be off.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_1|“Not coming? But you must. You know it is not only a request; it is an order from Miss Lauderdale. Every student is to be in East Hall at half-past eight.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_2|“whether it is an order or not; I’m not coming. Say nothing about me, please. I shall stay at home to-night.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_3|“But why? You will only get yourself into trouble, and there is surely no use in that. Oh, Annie, I know you are dreadfully unhappy about something, and I wish I could comfort you. Do — do let me.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_4|“I ought not to leave you. You ought to lie down and see a doctor. Do let me go and tell Miss Frere. I know your being ill will make all the difference.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_5|“How dare you interfere?
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_6|“You are to go, and say nothing about me. Because you happen to be my roomfellow, are you to control my actions? I am longing for you to leave the room. You don’t know what a trial it is for me to have you here. Why will you keep on prying, and fussing, and interfering. I want to be alone — go!”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_7|“I know you don’t quite mean what you say,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_8|“Before you came I had liberty,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_9|“You fret me beyond endurance. Since you came I feel myself tied and bound. Yes; you annoy me more than words can tell.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_10|“I am quite sure it is because she is so unhappy,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_11|“She does not know what she is saying. I ought not to mind her — I mean I ought not to be really hurt; but there is nothing for it but to leave her for the present.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_12|“is there not any message you would like me to take, Annie?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_13|“None; only go!”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_14|“there is no key in this lock; do you know where it is?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_15|“Took it out! And why, may I ask? Have the goodness to find it and put it back.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_16|“But don’t lock me out, please, Annie. You know on occasions you are absent-minded, and one-half of this room is mine when all’s said and done. I pay for it, and I have a right to it.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_17|“Oh, I won’t lock you out,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_18|“but I must have the key. Please find it before you go.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_19|“Coming in a moment, Jane,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_20|“you look as if something was worrying you.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_21|“but I don’t know that I ought to tell tales out of school.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_22|“Oh, I won’t press you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_23|“After all, perhaps you ought to know, Jane. I am unhappy about Annie Colchester.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_24|“if you begin to fret about the oddities of the college you will never know a moment’s peace. I am told that that extraordinary and most unpleasant girl, Belle Acheson, has begun to take to you. Now don’t, I beg of you, get into her set.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_25|“Oh, I shall never do that,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_26|“to get into any set: but I do wish to be kind to Belle, for I think she has good points in her. You see, all the girls except Eileen and Marjorie laugh at her, and that seems to me to make her worse.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_27|“I don’t quite go the length of laughing at her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_28|“But there, you are one of the ‘unco good,’ I am afraid.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_29|“Please don’t call me that,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_30|“Oh, I would not say a word to hurt you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_31|“I don’t know that I am at all what you say; but any girl ought to be popular and good who was brought up by a mother like mine,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_32|“Some day, Jane, you must see her. If you are in London during the summer, you must come and pay us a visit, will you?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_33|“I shall be only too delighted,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_34|“But now, Leslie, what is the trouble? that is, if you care to confide in me.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_35|“I believe poor Annie is dreadfully unhappy.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_36|“Poor dear, perhaps she is; but she ought to be on her way to East Hall by now. Miss Lauderdale will be very angry with anyone who does not attend.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_37|“That’s just it, Jane; that is what frightens me. She refuses to come.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_38|“Refuses to come?
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_39|“She will get into an awful scrape.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_40|“I believe she is ill, and does not quite know what she is saying,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_41|“She was very queer when I left her just now; that was why I was a little late. I felt her hand too, and it was very hot. I am sure she is ill. She works too hard, and she — — But there, I don’t know that I ought to say any more.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_42|“I’ll go back and speak to her. It is my duty to save her from getting into hopeless disgrace.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_43|“I have had the misfortune to irritate her a good deal during the last day or two, and you probably would have better success than I.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_44|“I won’t keep you a moment,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_45|“I am Jane Heriot; I want to speak to you at once. Let me in.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_46|“aren’t you coming to East Hall in response to Miss Lauderdale’s orders? You will get into a most awful scrape if you don’t. Do come, Annie; don’t be such a goose. Why, they may rusticate you. Do come, Annie, do!”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_47|“She seems to have turned both deaf and dumb, and I can do nothing with her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_48|“It is just possible that she may have gone down the back-stairs, and be already in the hall.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_49|“she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting. By the way, we ought to meet Marjorie and Eileen in the center hall.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_50|“The physical part of your training, and also the mental part, are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_51|“but the spiritual part, it seems to me, ought now to be strengthened. I want your whole threefold nature to get the best possible training while you are under my care, and I think that you girls of St. Wode’s ought to take steps to keep the souls which God has given you, the undying souls, strong and in health.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_52|“Hear, hear! and once again, hear!
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_53|“it was but to-day, Miss Lauderdale, I was speaking of the miserable dead souls which most of the students of St. Wode’s carry within their breasts.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_54|“Hush! no more speaking in hall,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_55|“I will talk with you, Belle Acheson, presently,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_56|“‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ you ask,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_57|“Annie Colchester is your roomfellow, is she not?
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_58|“Can you give me any idea why she has been absent to-night?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_59|“I don’t think she is quite well,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_60|“I see by your face, Miss Gilroy, that you are distressed about something. Are you keeping anything back?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_61|“Unless Miss Colchester’s illness is really very serious and needs a doctor, she will be very severely reprimanded for this willful disobedience to the command of her principal,
7233.girlsofstwodes_18_meade_64kb_62|“I will tell her. I will do my very best,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_0|“You will be glad when the term is over, won’t you?
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_1|“Thank you very much indeed for saying anything so nice,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_2|“and perhaps now you will allow me in my turn to make a remark. It is this: If by any chance you don’t leave St. Wode’s, Annie, I hope you will allow me to be your roomfellow again next term.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_3|“you speak of something which must not take place. I must pass in honors; if I don’t I shall die.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_4|“And you are certain to succeed,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_5|“I wish I could feel as sure of taking honors by and by in literature. I find these modern languages so very stiff.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_6|“I have to take German literature from 1500 to the death of Goethe,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_7|“The course is enormous, and I am sometimes almost in despair.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_8|“I do not mean to fail any more than you do,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_9|“It can never mean the same to you,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_10|“These letters have just come for you and Annie Colchester,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_11|“and, as I was coming upstairs, I thought I would leave them with you.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_12|“Here is a letter for you, Annie,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_13|“at last I have news.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_14|“At last I have news,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_15|“I have been starving, or, rather, I have been thirsting. You cannot tell what a thirst like mine means; and this, this is a cup of cold water.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_16|“Well, read it in peace,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_17|“I won’t disturb you. I am truly glad it has come.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_18|“Have you had bad news?
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_19|“It is quite late — between ten and eleven.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_20|“I don’t care. I must go into the grounds; the air is stifling.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_21|“But they are just shutting up.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_22|“I shall go — I know a way. Don’t say a word. I’ll be back presently.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_23|“How stupid of me to have forgotten about her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_24|“She ought to have been in bed and to have taken her cocoa an hour ago. Oh! now I remember; she got a letter which upset her very much and went out. Dear, dear! where can she be?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_25|“There is nothing for it but for me to go and look for her,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_26|“I was quite frightened about you.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_27|“Don’t begin! What do you mean?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_28|“I am not going to confide in you; so don’t think it. I only want to get into bed and to sleep.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_29|“Now, drink this at once,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_30|“if you really wish to sleep.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_31|“Do you want to kill me? Don’t talk any more. I am sleepy; I shall sleep.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_32|“Oh, do turn off the electric light,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_33|“Can’t you manage with a candle, just for once?”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_34|“By and by I must get her to tell me,
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_35|“but there is no use in worrying her now.”
7233.girlsofstwodes_16_meade_64kb_36|“Annie, is that you?
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_0|“What was the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at that story, or rather fable, which the count related?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_1|“Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my friend,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_2|“No, Hermine,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_3|“you cannot make me believe that; on the contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count’s. M. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much you care for his ill-humor. Someone has vexed you; I will allow no one to annoy you.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_4|“You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_5|“and what I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you remarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_6|“What is my daughter doing?
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_7|“She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_8|“Yet I think I hear her piano.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_9|“It is Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in bed.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_10|“come and undress me.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_11|“My dear M. Lucien,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_12|“you are always complaining that Eugénie will not address a word to you.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_13|“I am not the only one who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_14|“yet I think this will all pass off, and that you will one day see her enter your study.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_15|“My study?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_16|“At least that of the minister.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_17|“Why so!”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_18|“To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_19|“let her come, with your consent and that of the baron, and we will try and give her an engagement, though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_20|“Go, Cornélie,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_21|“I do not require you any longer.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_22|“Come, Hermine,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_23|“answer candidly, — something vexes you — is it not so?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_24|“I am frightful tonight,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_25|“Good-evening, madame,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_26|“good-evening, M. Debray.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_27|“Read me something, M. Debray,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_28|“Excuse me,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_29|“but you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_30|“M. Lucien,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_31|“I assure you I have no desire to sleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_32|“I am at your service, madame,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_33|“My dear M. Debray,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_34|“do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_35|“Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_36|“oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_37|“It is extraordinary,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_38|“how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over us.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_39|“Do you know, sir,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_40|“that you are improving? Generally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_41|“It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_42|“And what have I to do with your ill-humor?
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_43|“do these things concern me? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have clerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_44|“Not so,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_45|“And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain yourself more clearly, I beg, sir.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_46|“Oh, make yourself easy! — I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon know what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_47|“I do not understand you, sir,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_48|“You understand me perfectly, on the contrary,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_49|“but, if you will persist, I will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs upon the Spanish loan.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_50|“And pray,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_51|“am I responsible for this loss?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_52|“Why not?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_53|“Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_54|“Certainly it is not mine.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_55|“Once for all, sir,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_56|“I tell you I will not hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_57|“Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_58|“Really?
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_59|“Well, this surprises me, for I thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs!”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_60|“I? What could put such an idea into your head?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_61|“Yourself.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_62|“Ah? — what next?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_63|“Most assuredly.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_64|“I should like to know upon what occasion?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_65|“When are you coming to the point?
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_66|“Patience, madame, I am coming to it.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_67|“That’s fortunate.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_68|“Well, sir, and what then?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_69|“Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_70|“Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a fourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_71|“What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray’s name is mixed up in this affair.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_72|“Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must have lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_73|“will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_74|“Oh, this is too much,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_75|“you are worse than despicable.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_76|“A probable thing!”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_77|“Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this? — a false telegraphic despatch — it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for me — I am sure of it.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_78|“Sir,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_79|“are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with him, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_80|“Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a sleepless night, which has caused the minister’s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_81|“if all this is, as you say, caused by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_82|“Do I know M. Debray? — do I wish to know him? — do I wish to know that he gives advice? — do I wish to follow it? — do I speculate? No; you do all this, not I.”
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_83|“Foolish creature,
47.count_of_monte_cristo_065_dumas_64kb_84|“M. de Villefort! — What do you mean?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_0|“In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_1|“Yes.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_2|“What did you think the vittles was for?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_3|“For a dog.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_4|“So’d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_5|“Why?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_6|“Because part of it was watermelon.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_7|“So it was — I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don’t see at the same time.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_8|“All right — bring it out.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_9|“My plan is this,
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_10|“Work? Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing to it. What’s the good of a plan that ain’t no more trouble than that? It’s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_11|“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about? Don’t I generly know what I’m about?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_12|“Yes.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_13|“Didn’t I say I was going to help steal the nigger?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_14|“Here’s the ticket. This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_15|“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should hope we can find a way that’s a little more complicated than that, Huck Finn.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_16|“how’ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_17|“That’s more like,
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_18|“It’s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_19|“but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long. There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_20|“Now we’re all right. We’ll dig him out. It’ll take about a week!”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_21|“What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_22|“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at ’im?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_23|“You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn’t the plan.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_24|“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan now.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_25|“Why, Huck! En good lan’! ain’ dat Misto Tom?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_26|“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_27|“Does who know us?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_28|“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_29|“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_30|“What put it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowed you?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_31|“Well, that’s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? what did he sing out?
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_32|“Did you hear anybody sing out?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_33|“No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_34|“Did you sing out?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_35|“I hain’t said nothing, sah.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_36|“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_37|“Did you ever see us before?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_38|“No, sah; not as I knows on.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_39|“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_40|“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t give him up, I’d hang him.
2374.huckleberryfinn_34_twain_64kb_41|“Don’t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_0|“Begone you Tige! you Spot! begone sah!
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_1|“It’s you, at last! — ain’t it?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_2|“You don’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it’s your cousin Tom! — tell him howdy.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_3|“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away — or did you get your breakfast on the boat?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_4|“Now I can have a good look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What kep’ you? — boat get aground?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_5|“Don’t say yes’m — say Aunt Sally. Where’d she get aground?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_6|“It warn’t the grounding — that didn’t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_7|“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_8|“No’m. Killed a nigger.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_9|“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_10|“Who’d you give the baggage to?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_11|“Nobody.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_12|“Why, child, it’ll be stole!”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_13|“Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_14|“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_15|“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_32_twain_64kb_16|“Here he comes! Stick your head down lower — there, that’ll do; you can’t be seen now. Don’t you let on you’re here. I’ll play a joke on him. Children, don’t you say a word.”

I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind acknowledging ’t I’m right down scared. But there’s no hope that he’s come; for he couldn’t come and me miss him.

2374.huckleberryfinn_23_twain_64kb_15|“Yes, a duke’s different. But not very different. This one’s a middling hard lot for a duke. When he’s drunk, there ain’t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_23_twain_64kb_17|“It’s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we’ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that’s out of kings.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_2|“Wher’ you bound for, young man?”

2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_6|“Did anybody send ’em word?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_7|“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does he live?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_8|“Oh, he lives in England — Sheffield — preaches there — hasn’t ever been in this country. He hasn’t had any too much time — and besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_9|“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_10|“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. I’m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_11|“It’s a pretty long journey. But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_12|“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about fourteen — that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_13|“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_14|“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_15|“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop there. When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_16|“Was Peter Wilks well off?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_17|“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_18|“When did you say he died?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_19|“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_21|“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_22|“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_23|“Yes, sir, it’s the best way. Ma used to always say that.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_24|“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags. And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_24_twain_64kb_26|“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ’em, can’t it?”

2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_2|“I hain’t come back — I hain’t been gone.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_3|“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on you. Honest injun now, you ain’t a ghost?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_4|“Honest injun, I ain’t,
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_5|“Well — I — I — well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can’t somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn’t you ever murdered at all?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_6|“No. I warn’t ever murdered at all — I played it on them. You come in here and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_7|“It’s all right; I’ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it’s your’n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I’ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn’t let on to know me at first.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_8|“All right; but wait a minute. There’s one more thing — a thing that nobody don’t know but me. And that is, there’s a nigger here that I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is Jim — old Miss Watson’s Jim.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_9|“I know what you’ll say. You’ll say it’s dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? I’m low down; and I’m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on. Will you?”

2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_20|“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_21|“Oh, I can’t make you so much trouble; I couldn’t think of it. I’ll walk — I don’t mind the distance.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_22|“But we won’t let you walk — it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to do it. Come right in.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_23|“it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay. It’s a long, dusty three mile, and we can’t let you walk. And, besides, I’ve already told ’em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us. Come right in and make yourself at home.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_24|“You owdacious puppy!”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_25|“I’m surprised at you, m’am.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_26|“You’re s’rp — Why, what do you reckon I am? I’ve a good notion to take and — Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_27|“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am. I didn’t mean no harm. I — I — thought you’d like it.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_34|“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to. They all said, kiss her; and said she’d like it. They all said it — every one of them. But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more — I won’t, honest.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_35|“You won’t, won’t you? Well, I sh’d reckon you won’t!”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_36|“No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it again — till you ask me.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_37|“Till I ask you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you — or the likes of you.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_39|“Why, no; I — I — well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”

2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_42|“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn’t looking for you at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_43|“It’s because it warn’t intended for any of us to come but Tom,
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_44|“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”
2374.huckleberryfinn_33_twain_64kb_45|“I reckon there ain’t going to be any; and you couldn’t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they’ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.”

5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_32|“Seriously, then, dear M. Fouquet, I have certain funds which somewhat embarrass me. I am tired of investing my money in lands, and am anxious to intrust it to some friend who will turn it to account.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_33|“Surely it does not press,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_34|“On the contrary, it is very pressing.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_35|“Very well, we will talk of that by and by.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_36|“By and by will not do, for my money is there,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_37|“Madame, madame,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_38|“what opinion can you have of me, when you make me such an offer?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_39|“Tell me, rather, what you yourself think of the step I have taken.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_40|“You bring me this money for myself, and you bring it because you know me to be embarrassed. Nay, do not deny it, for I am sure of it. Can I not read your heart?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_41|“If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer you?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_42|“I have guessed rightly, then,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_43|“In truth, madame, I have never yet given you the right to insult me in this manner.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_44|“what singular delicacy of feeling! You tell me you love me; in the name of that affection you wish me to sacrifice my reputation and my honor, yet, when I offer you money which is my own, you refuse me.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_45|“A short time since, M. Fouquet, you were wanting in judgment; now you are wanting in feeling.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_46|“overwhelm me, madame, for I have nothing to reply.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_47|“I offered you my friendship, M. Fouquet.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_48|“Yes, madame, and you limited yourself to that.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_49|“And what I am now doing is the act of a friend.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_50|“No doubt it is.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_51|“And you reject this mark of my friendship?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_52|“I do reject it.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_53|“Monsieur Fouquet, look at me,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_54|“I now offer you my love.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_55|“Oh! madame, you overwhelm me beneath a load of happiness.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_56|“Will you be happy, then, if I am yours -- entirely?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_57|“It will be the supremest happiness for me.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_58|“Take me, then. If, however, for your sake I sacrifice a prejudice, do you, for mine, sacrifice a scruple.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_59|“Do not refuse me.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_60|“Think seriously of what you are proposing.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_61|“Fouquet, but one word. Let it be ‘No,’ and I open this door,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_62|“and you will never see me again. Let that word be ‘Yes,’ and I am yours entirely.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_63|“Elise! Elise! But this coffer?”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_64|“Contains my dowry.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_65|“It is your ruin,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_66|“there must be a million here.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_67|“Yes, my jewels, for which I care no longer if you do not love me, and for which, equally, I care no longer if you love me as I love you.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_68|“This is too much,
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_69|“I yield, I yield, even were it only to consecrate so much devotion. I accept the dowry.”
5863.tenyearslater_28_dumas_64kb_70|“And take the woman with it,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_0|“whatever may happen,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_1|“I think it is now time to take leave of each other. The tide, you perceive, is rising; ten minutes hence it will have soaked the sands where we are now walking in such a manner that we shall not be able to keep our footing.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_2|“But, you mean, we are still upon soil which is part of the king’s territory.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_3|“Yes; but we can hardly reach it now, without getting our feet wet.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_4|“Yes; but observe that it forms an eminence tolerably high, and that the tide rises up on every side, leaving the top free. We shall be admirably placed upon that little theatre. What do you think of it?”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_5|“I shall be perfectly happy wherever I may have the honor of crossing my sword with your lordship’s.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_6|“My reason for not walking faster was, that I did not wish to precede your Grace. Are you still on dry land, my lord?”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_7|“You will observe, my lord, that in turning your back to them, you will have the sun full in your face.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_8|“Oh, its rays are very feeble at this hour and it will soon disappear; do not be uneasy on that score.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_9|“As you please, my lord; it was out of consideration for your lordship that I made the remark.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_10|“I am aware of that, M. de Wardes, and I fully appreciate your kindness. Shall we take off our doublets?”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_11|“As you please, my lord.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_12|“Do not hesitate to tell me, M. de Wardes, if you do not feel comfortable upon the wet sand, or if you think yourself a little too close to French territory. We could fight in England, or even upon my yacht.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_13|“Upon my word, your Grace,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_14|“we shall hardly have time to begin. Do you not perceive how our feet are sinking into the sand?”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_15|“I have sunk up to the ankles,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_16|“without reckoning that the water is even now breaking in upon us.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_17|“It has already reached me. As soon as you please, therefore, your Grace,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_18|“And I, my lord, have only this to reply to you: I have not disliked you hitherto, but, since you give me such a character, I hate you, and will do all I possibly can to kill you;
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_19|“You are wounded, my lord,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_20|“Yes, monsieur, but only slightly.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_21|“Yet you quitted your guard.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_22|“Only from the first effect of the cold steel, but I have recovered. Let us go on, if you please.
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_23|“it is now your turn.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_24|“Are you dead, marquis?”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_25|“but very near it.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_26|“Well, what is to be done; can you walk?
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_27|“call to your people, or I shall be drowned.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_28|“Halloa! boat there! quick, quick!”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_29|“take the marquis on shore first.”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_30|“Death to the Frenchman!
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_31|“Wretched knaves!
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_32|“obey directly! M. de Wardes on shore! M. de Wardes’s safety to be looked to first, or I will have you all hanged!”
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_33|“I commit him to your care, as you value your lives,
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_34|“Take M. de Wardes on shore.
5863.tenyearslater_29_dumas_64kb_35|“From my master, his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, in order that every possible care may be taken of the Marquis de Wardes.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_0|“Yes, yes,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_1|“Yes, we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_2|“Under any circumstances,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_3|“But, first,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_4|“you must present me to Madame du Vallon.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_5|“I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_6|“and you find me still in affliction on that account. That was the reason why I left my Chateau du Vallon near Corbeil, and came to my estate, Bracieux. Poor Madame du Vallon! her temper was uncertain, but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_7|“So you are free now, and rich?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_8|“I am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year. Let us go to breakfast.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_9|“I shall be happy to do so; the morning air has made me hungry.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_10|“my air is excellent.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_11|“this is my usual style.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_12|“Devil take me!
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_13|“I wish you joy of it. The king has nothing like it.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_14|“I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal, Monsieur de Mazarin. Taste this cutlet, my dear D’Artagnan; ’tis off one of my sheep.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_15|“You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it.
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_16|“Yes, the sheep are fed in my meadows, which are excellent pasture.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_17|“Give me another cutlet.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_18|“No, try this hare, which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_19|“Zounds! what a flavor!
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_20|“ah! they are fed on thyme only, your hares.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_21|“And how do you like my wine?
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_22|“it is pleasant, isn’t it?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_23|“It is nothing, however, but a wine of the country.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_24|“Yes, a small declivity to the south, yonder on my hill, gives me twenty hogsheads.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_25|“Quite a vineyard, hey?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_26|“Excellent, my dear friend; better than ever. I could kill an ox with a blow of my fist.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_27|“Well, then, family affairs, perhaps?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_28|“Family! I have, happily, only myself in the world to care for.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_29|“But what makes you sigh?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_30|“My dear fellow,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_31|“to be candid with you, I am not happy.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_32|“You are not happy, Porthos? You who have chateau, meadows, mountains, woods — you who have forty thousand francs a year — you — are — not — happy?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_33|“My dear friend, all those things I have, but I am a hermit in the midst of superfluity.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_34|“Surrounded, I suppose, only by clodhoppers, with whom you could not associate.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_35|“that you are a widower, your wife’s connection cannot injure you.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_36|“A baron, don’t you mean?
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_37|“would I were but a baron!”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_38|“Well, my friend, I am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_39|“I am glad to see,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_40|“that you have still that honest lad with you.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_41|“He is my steward,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_42|“he will never leave me. Go away now, Mouston.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_43|“So he’s called Mouston,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_44|“’tis too long a word to pronounce ‘Mousqueton.’”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_45|“let us resume our conversation later, your people may suspect something; there may be spies about. You can suppose, Porthos, that what I have to say relates to most important matters.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_46|“Devil take them; let us walk in the park,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_47|“for the sake of digestion.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_48|“the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren; you are a happy man, my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase, but acquired that of fishing.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_49|“My friend,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_50|“I leave fishing to Mousqueton, — it is a vulgar pleasure, — but I shoot sometimes; that is to say, when I am dull, and I sit on one of those marble seats, have my gun brought to me, my favorite dog, and I shoot rabbits.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_51|“Really, how very amusing!”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_52|“Yes,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_53|“it is amusing.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_54|“However, what had you to say to me?
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_55|“let us return to that subject.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_56|“I must, however, first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_57|“Go into harness again, gird on your sword, run after adventures, and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_58|“Ah! hang it!
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_59|“I see you are spoiled, dear friend; you are corpulent, your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal’s guards have so many proofs.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_60|“Ah! my fist is strong enough I swear,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_61|“So much the better.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_62|“Are we then to go to war?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_63|“By my troth, yes.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_64|“Against whom?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_65|“Are you a politician, friend?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_66|“Not in the least.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_67|“Are you for Mazarin or for the princes?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_68|“I am for no one.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_69|“That is to say, you are for us. Well, I tell you that I come to you from the cardinal.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_70|“Ho! ho! What are the wishes of his eminence?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_71|“He wishes to have you in his service.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_72|“And who spoke to him of me?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_73|“Rochefort — you remember him?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_74|“Yes, pardieu! It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much; you gave him three sword-wounds in three separate engagements.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_75|“But you know he is now our friend?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_76|“No, I didn’t know that. So he cherishes no resentment?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_77|“You are mistaken, Porthos,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_78|“It is I who cherish no resentment.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_79|“You say, then,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_80|“that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_81|“Yes, and the queen, too.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_82|“The queen, do you say?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_83|“To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarin’s hands that famous diamond — you remember all about it — that I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which, I don’t know how, she has regained possession.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_84|“But it seems to me,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_85|“that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_86|“but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies; nevertheless, since they are the ones who have riches and honors, we are devoted to them.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_87|“Yes, we are devoted to them,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_88|“and you — to whom are you devoted now?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_89|“To the king, the queen, and to the cardinal; moreover, I have answered for your devotion also.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_90|“And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_91|“Magnificent, my dear fellow, magnificent! In the first place you have plenty of money, haven’t you? forty thousand francs income, I think you said.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_92|“Eh! my friend,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_93|“one never has too much money. Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder; I am not much of a hand at figures, so that I live almost from hand to mouth.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_94|“He is afraid I have come to borrow money,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_95|“Ah, my friend,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_96|“it is all the better if you are in difficulties.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_97|“How is it all the better?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_98|“Yes, for his eminence will give you all that you want — land, money, and titles.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_99|“Ah! ah! ah!
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_100|“we didn’t know enough to make our profits; this, however, doesn’t concern you, with your forty thousand francs income, the happiest man in the world, it seems to me.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_101|“notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year, and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year, it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage, hey?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_102|“Yes indeed,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_103|“For my part,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_104|“I desire to be made a baron.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_105|“You shall be one.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_106|“And have you not seen any of our other friends?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_107|“Yes, I have seen Aramis.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_108|“And what does he wish? To be a bishop?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_109|“Aramis, fancy, has become a monk and a Jesuit, and lives like a bear. My offers did not arouse him, — did not even tempt him.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_110|“So much the worse! He was a clever man. And Athos?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_111|“I have not yet seen him. Do you know where I shall find him?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_112|“Near Blois. He is called Bragelonne. Only imagine, my dear friend. Athos, who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte, what is he to do with all those dignities — the Comte de la Fere, Comte de Bragelonne?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_113|“And he has no children with all these titles?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_114|“I have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_115|“Well, I shall see him to-morrow and tell him about you; but I’m afraid, entre nous, that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_116|“Yes, he used to drink a great deal,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_117|“And then he was older than any of us,

57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_119|“Well then, if we can get Athos, all will be well. If we cannot, we will do without him. We two are worth a dozen.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_120|“but we four, altogether, would be equal to thirty-six, more especially as you say the work will not be child’s play. Will it last long?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_121|“By’r Lady! two or three years perhaps.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_122|“So much the better,
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_123|“Ah, things go on gaily, then,

57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_125|“We shall have set battles, cannonades, conflagrations and there will be great variety.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_126|“Well, then, I decide.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_127|“I have your word, then?”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_128|“But he must make me a baron.”
57.twentyyearsafter_11_dumas_64kb_129|“that’s settled already; I will be responsible for the barony.”
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_0|"I picked up some special permits,
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_1|"I knew you had this cannon, gov'nor, and I figured it'd come in handy. Wouldn't be caught dead with one myself. Knives, that's my specialty. Come on, Cap'n, we gotta get out the vote."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_2|"In the first place, I'm not registered."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_3|"Every cop's registered in his own precinct; Wayne got the honor system fixed for us. Show your papers and go into any booth in your territory. That's all. And you'd better be seen voting often, too, Cap'n. What's your precinct?"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_4|"Eleventh, but I'm not voting. I'd like to come along with you to observe, but I wouldn't make any choice between Wayne and Nolan."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_5|"Come on, you. We're late. And I ain't staying on the streets when it gets going."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_6|"Come on, you gees. I gotta be back in half an hour."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_7|"You mugs get the hell out of -- Oh, cops! Okay, better pin these on."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_8|"We got territory to cover."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_9|"Just a friend on the way to his own route. Eleventh Precinct."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_10|"He's been dead for ten years. I know him. He's my uncle."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_11|"There's a Mike Thaler registered, and this guy says he's Thaler,
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_12|"Heh-heh, yes, just a mix-up. He's registered, so he votes."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_13|"Owen Murtagh."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_14|"Murtang.... No registration!
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_15|"When a man can't get the name straight the first time, it's suspicious."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_16|"Better check the name off, unless the real Murtagh shows up. Any objections, Yeoman?"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_17|"Saves trouble, unless you want to do it yourself,
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_18|"Wayne'll win, but not that easy. The sticks don't have strong mobs, and they'll pile up a heavy Nolan vote. And you'll see things hum soon!"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_19|"Inside the dome! They're poisoning the air."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_20|"I've had enough. I've made up my mind,

7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_22|"Come off the head-cop role; it won't work. They must have had reports on elections before this."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_23|"Okay, it's your death certificate,
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_24|"Go send your sob stories, Murdoch."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_25|"It ain't right, gov'nor."

7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_27|"Mrs. Mary Edelstein,
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_28|"Get out, Gordon, before they gang up on us!"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_29|"Get the old man!"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_30|"Or should I carry you?"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_31|"I'll walk. Get me to a place where we can talk -- and be damned to this. Gordon, I've got to talk -- but I don't have to live. I mean that!"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_32|"A man in distress!
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_33|"Yes. Pappa is dead, God forbid it. He would try to vote. I told him and told him -- and then ... With my own hands, I carried him here."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_34|"No. Pappa is dead. He needs no beds now, and your friend is suffering; put him here."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_35|"I'll get alcohol from below -- and bandages and hot water."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_36|"Let them go, kid. There's no way to save me now. And listen!"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_37|"Gordon, you're a self-made louse, but you're a man underneath it somewhere. That's why we rate you higher than you think you are. That's why I'm going to trust you -- because I have to."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_38|"He was a clerk once for Security. But nobody came, nobody called...."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_39|"Probably what happened to a lot -- men like Trench, supposed to build an organization, just leaving the loose ends hanging.
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_40|"Hell's going to pop. The government's just waiting to step in; Earth wants to take over."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_41|"Take it. You're head of Security on Mars now. It's all authorized in the plans there. You'll need the brains and knowledge of the others -- but they can't act. You can -- we know about you."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_42|"So Security wants me to contact the others in the book and organize things?"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_43|"Not a good chance, then -- but a chance. Still time -- I think. Gordon?"
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_44|"Dead, fighting wind-mills. And maybe winning. I don't know."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_45|"I should have watched her. It is a bad day for me, young man. I failed Pappa; I failed the poor man who died -- and now I have failed you. It is better..."
7585.policeyourplanet_08_delray_64kb_46|"Upstairs, please,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_0|"So we figured when we found the stiffs maybe you'd come back, Mother. Damn good thing we were right. We can sure use that ammunition you found. Now, where's this Gordon fellow?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_1|"I'll be doggoned. Whyn't you say he was with Murdoch?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_2|"They want someone to locate Ed Praeger and see about getting some food shipped in from outside, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_3|"They got some money scraped together, but the hicks are doing no business with Marsport. You know Ed -- just tell him I sent you. I'd go myself, but I'm getting too old to go chasing men out there."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_4|"Heart like a steel trap, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_5|"Well, you'll be earning your keep here -- yours and that granddaughter's, too. Here -- you'll need directions for finding Praeger."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_6|"Should turn 'em over to us cops,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_7|"What's he hanged for?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_8|"All food should be turned in,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_9|"We can trust you, I guess,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_10|"Remember you with Murdoch, anyhow. And you can tell Praeger we got plenty of men looking for work, in case he can use 'em."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_11|"Extra air inside, and the best we could do for food. Was gonna try myself, but I don't know Praeger,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_12|"Good luck, Gordon -- and damn it, we're -- we gotta eat, don't we? You tell him that! It ain't much -- but get what you can!"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_13|"You won't find Praeger on his farm -- couldn't reach it in that, anyhow,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_14|"Ed! Hey, Ed!"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_15|"I can get the stuff sent, Gordon. I'm head of the shipping committee for this quadrant. But why in hell should I? The last time, every car was looted in Outer Marsport. If they won't let us get the oil and chemicals we need, why should we feed them?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_16|"Ever see starvation?
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_17|"Hell, who wouldn't loot your trains if that's going on?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_18|"All right, if Mother Corey'll back up this volunteer police group. I've got kids of my own.... Look, you want food, we want to ship. Get your cops to give us an escort for every shipment through to the dome, and we'll drop off one car out of four for the outlands."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_19|"Provided the first shipment carries the most we can get for the credits I brought."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_20|"It will -- we've got some stuff that's about to spoil, and we can let you have a whole train of it.
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_21|"A damned good thing Security's sending a ship. Credits won't be worth much until they get this mess straightened out."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_22|"What makes you think Security can do anything? They haven't shown a hand yet."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_23|"You guys in Marsport feed yourselves so many lies you begin to believe them. But Security took Venus -- and I'm not worried here, in the long run. Don't ask me how."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_24|"Along with how many war rockets?
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_25|"I'll take the drag car."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_26|"And news for the paper, if I ever publish it again. I came over because I wasn't much use at the Coop, and everyone else was busy."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_27|"Running Outer Marsport. The Mother's the only man everybody knows, I guess -- and his word has never been broken that anyone can remember. So he's helping Schulberg make agreements with the sections the volunteers don't handle. Place is lousy with people now. Heard about Mayor Wayne?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_28|"He must have had his supply of drugs lifted somehow. He holed up one day, until it really hit him that he couldn't get any more. Then he went gunning for Trench, with some idea Trench had swiped the stuff -- so Trench is now running the Municipals. And I hear the gangs are just about in control of both sections, lately."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_29|"Forget all you're thinking, Cuddles. I'm still not bothering unwilling women -- and I'll even close my eyes when you dress."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_30|"They called it bundling once, I think. I -- Bruce, I know you don't like me, so I guess it isn't too hard for you. But -- sometimes ... Oh, damn it! Sometimes you're -- nice!"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_31|"Nice people don't get to Mars. They stay on Earth, being careful not to find out what it's like up here,
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_32|"I know. The Kid -- Rusty's friend -- wrote down what they did to him."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_33|"I'm declaring myself in!
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_34|"You know enough about Security badges to know they can't be forged. That one has my name on it, and rating as a Prime. Do you want to shoot me, or will you follow orders?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_35|"I lost connection years ago, Gordon. But this makes you my boss."
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_36|"Then give it all the publicity you can, and tell them Security has just declared war on the whole damned dome section! Mother, I want all the dope we found!
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_37|"After your deal with Praeger, we'd probably follow you anyhow. I don't cotton to Security, Gordon -- but those devils in there are making our kids starve!"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_38|"Is it true about Security sending a ship?
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_39|"What happens when they arrive, Bruce?"
7585.policeyourplanet_15_delray_64kb_40|"Who knows? Who cares? I'll see that they know you weren't guilty, though. Stop worrying about it."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_0|"You seem to have friends here,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_1|"A good thing I was trying to catch up with you. Just missed you at the Precinct House, came after you, and saw you turn in here. Then I heard the rumpus. A good thing for me, too, maybe."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_2|"How so? And what happened?
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_3|"One's the result of the other,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_4|"Forget that part. There's room enough for two in my place -- and I guess Mother Corey won't mind. I'm damned glad you were following me."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_5|"So'm I, Gordon. What'll we do with the prisoners?"
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_6|"Leave 'em; we couldn't get a Croopster locked up tonight for anything."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_7|"This is the first time I've had to look you up,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_8|"I've been going out nights to help the citizens organize against the Stonewall gang. But that's over now -- they gave me hell for inciting vigilante action, and confined me inside the dome. The way they hate a decent cop here, you'd think honesty was contagious."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_9|"It's your room, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_10|"Number forty-two."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_11|"Thanks, Gordon. I'm turning in right now."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_12|"I'm from the Ajax Householders Protection Group,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_13|"Not long on Mars, are you?
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_14|"What does your boss Jurgens figure on doing, punk? Taking over all the rackets for the whole city?"
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_15|"To me, it's nothing,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_16|"Take these two back to young Jurgens, boys, and tell him to keep his punks out of my house."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_17|"As I was going to say, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_18|"we've got a little social game going upstairs -- the room with the window. Fine view of the parades. We need a fourth."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_19|"This is Ed Praeger. He's an engineer on our railroad."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_20|"So there really is a surrounding countryside,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_21|"There are even cities out there, Gordon. Nothing like Marsport, but that's no loss. That's where the real population of Mars is -- decent people, men who are going to turn this into a real planet some day."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_22|"There are plenty like that here, too,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_23|"First ace deals. Damn it, Mother, sit down-wind from me, won't you? Or else take a bath."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_24|"I got a surprise for you, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_25|"Nobody goes back,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_26|"A lot don't want to,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_27|"I never meant to go back. I've got me a farm up north. Another ten years, and I retire to it. My kids are up there now -- grandkids, that is. They're Martians; maybe you won't believe me, but they can breathe the air here without a helmet."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_28|"They'll take the planet away from Earth yet,
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_29|"Marsport is strictly artificial. It's kept going only because it's the only place where Earth will set down her ships. If Security doesn't do anything, time will."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_30|"Yeah, I know. The government set them up, gave them a mixture of powers, and has been trying to keep them from working ever since. But somehow they did clean up Venus; and every crook here is scared to death of the name. How come a muckraking newspaperman like you never turned up anything on them, Gordon?"
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_31|"Don't sell them short, cobber. I did -- once.... You forget them, here, after a while. But they're around...."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_32|"If Security's so damned powerful, why doesn't it stop that?
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_33|"They might do it, Gordon. They just might. But are you sure you want it stopped?"
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_34|"This is a social game, cobbers."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_35|"Trench took forever giving it to us, Mother. But it's the same old deal; all the police gees get tomorrow off -- you, too, gov'nor. No cops to influence the vote, that's the word. We even gotta wear civvies when we go out to vote for Wayne."
7585.policeyourplanet_07_delray_64kb_36|"Put a uniform on some men and they begin to believe they're cops, eh, cobber?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_0|"I knew it, gov'nor -- knew it the minute I heard Jurgens was a cop. Did you make 'em give you my beat?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_1|"Guess what, gov'nor. The Legals bought Randy's Crusader. Traded him an old job press and a bag of scratch for his reputation."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_2|"You'll be late, Izzy,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_3|"You've got a wife home, muckraker. You don't have to eat this filth."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_4|"Yeah, the Legals want the Crusader for their propaganda,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_5|"New slogans and new uniforms, and none of them mean anything. Here!
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_6|"My mother's wedding ring. Give it to her -- and if you tell her it came from me, I'll rip out your guts!"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_7|"Food ready in ten minutes,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_8|"I got a duplicate key. Yours is in there,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_9|"Yeah, I know. Your meal ticket was in danger. Okay, you've done your nightly duty. Now get the hell out of my room, will you?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_10|"It's a helluva roundabout way of doing things, gov'nor, but if the gees pay for protection any old way, then they're gonna get it!"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_11|"I told you you had a punched meal ticket,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_12|"I got a job today -- barmaid, on your beat, where being your wife helps."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_13|"Go to bed. You look beat. I'll sand these."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_14|"You all see it. We're going to arrest Wayne. By jingo, they can't say we ain't legal now! Every odd-numbered shield goes from every precinct. Gordon, Isaacs -- you two been talking big about law and order. Here's the warrant. Take it and arrest Wayne!"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_15|"The princess? She sure is."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_16|"They'll ruin the dome yet. Why can't they stick to knives?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_17|"Cut speed! Left sharp!
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_18|"Wayne, you're under arrest!"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_19|"So the bad pennies turn up. You damned fools, you should have stuck. I had big plans for you, Gordon. I've still got them, if you don't insist..."
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_20|"Lucky we found a good car to steal,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_21|"I'm getting old, cobbers. Once I broke every strong-man record on Earth -- still stand, too. But not now. Senile!"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_22|"You didn't have to come,
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_23|"When my own granddaughter comes crying for help? When she finally admits she needs her old grandfather?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_24|"Gov'nor, if you're right, and the plain gees pay my salary, who's paying me to start fighting other cops? Or is it maybe that somebody isn't being exactly honest with the scratch they lift from the gees?"
7585.policeyourplanet_13_delray_64kb_25|"We still have to eat,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_0|"You're going to be busy,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_1|"You five will come with me. I'm going to show how we operate. The rest of you can team up any way you want tonight, pick any route that's open. Okay, men, let's go."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_2|"Then you should be ashamed to be in this mess. But whatever your reasons, you'll be useful. Take those two and give them some lessons, while I do the same with these."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_3|"A good clubbing beats hanging,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_4|"But it has to be good. Go in for business, and don't stop just because the other guy quits. Give them hell!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_5|"Knock them out and kick them down!
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_6|"And don't let them get away!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_7|"Where are you going?"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_8|"To find a phone and call the wagon."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_9|"We're not using wagons,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_10|"Take him aside. Names."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_11|"I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_12|"Colonel, they'd kill me! I don't know."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_13|"If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you. Now get out of this district, or get honest jobs! Because every time one of my men sees one of you, this will happen again. And you can pass the word along that the Stonewall gang is dead!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_14|"I've heard the theory, but never saw it in practice. Suppose the whole gang jumps us at once?"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_15|"Then we're taken. The old book I got the idea from didn't mention that."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_16|"We'd better shift to another territory,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_17|"Object lesson!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_18|"Get a stretcher, and take him wherever he belongs,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_19|"I'm leaving you two able to walk for that. But if you get caught again, you'll get still worse."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_20|"Poor devils!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_21|"I've got a yellow ticket, from Security."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_22|"So you're that Gordon? But you're still a good cop."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_23|"What makes you think Wayne will be re-elected? Nobody wants him, except a gang of crooks and those in power."
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_24|"Ever see a Martian election? No, you're a firster. He can't lose! And then hell is going to pop, and this whole planet may be blown wide open!"
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_25|"It didn't affect Honest Izzy,
7585.policeyourplanet_04_delray_64kb_26|"Nope. Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it. But you got Earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once. Too bad.
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_0|"Maybe I didn't do you a favor, gov'nor, pulling you here. I dunno. I got some pics of Trench from a guy I know. That's how I got my beat so fast in the Seventh. But Trench ain't married, and I guess I've used up the touch. Maybe I could try it, though."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_1|"I'll work it out somehow."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_2|"High man for sixty,
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_3|"Izzy said you'd be around. Sorry my man drew that knife on you the last time, Corporal."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_4|"Accidents will happen, Fats."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_5|"How come you're walking beat, anyhow? With what you pulled here, you should have bought a captaincy."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_6|"Well, that's Mars,
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_7|"It ain't honest, gov'nor. If the gees in the wagon clean him, or the desk man gets it, that's their business. But I'm going to run a straight beat, or else!"
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_8|"Captain says report in person at once,
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_9|"Gordon, what does Security want with you?"
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_10|"Security? Not a damned thing, if I can help it. They kicked me off Earth on a yellow ticket, if that's what you mean."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_11|"official business
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_12|"Okay, probably routine. Only next time, Gordon, put the facts on your record with the Force. If you're a deportee, it should show up. That's all!"
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_13|"Pick up the snow, too."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_14|"Good God, Sergeant,
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_15|"leave me something! I'll make it right. I'll cut you in. I gotta have some of that for myself!"
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_16|"Let him feel it a while. No sense jailing him yet. Bloody fool had no business starting without lining the groove. Anyhow, we'll get a bunch of credits for the stuff when we turn it in."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_17|"We get a quarter value. Captain probably gets fifty per cent from one of the pushers who's lined with him. Everybody's happy."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_18|"Why not push it ourselves?
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_19|"Wouldn't be honest, gov'nor. Cops are supposed to turn it in."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_20|"Good work -- you, too, Gordon. Best week in the territory for a couple of months. I guess the citizens like you, the way they treat you.
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_21|"You have a better chance with more tickets. A much better chance!"
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_22|"Thanks, Gordon. That fills my quota. Look, you've been on overtime all week. Why not skip the meeting? Isaacs can brief you, later. Go out and get drunk, or something."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_23|"I'll go home and rest. Drinking costs too much for what I make. It's a good thing you don't have income tax here."
7585.policeyourplanet_06_delray_64kb_24|"forty per cent. Better make out a form next week, and start paying it regularly. But you can deduct your contributions here."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_0|"That does it, gov'nor. It ain't honest, treating us this way. If the crackle comes from the people, and these gees give everybody a skull cracking, then they're crooks. It ain't honest, and I'm too sick to work. And if that bloody doctor won't agree..."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_1|"Get out of my way, you damned Legal machine!
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_2|"He hasn't seen it yet, I guess. Here, gov'nor!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_3|"At his plant. At least he left for it, according to Sheila."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_4|"You're staying here, Cuddles. You're supposed to be a woman now, remember!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_5|"The damned fool opened up on the border -- figured he'd circulate to both sections,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_6|"We'd better get out a block up and walk. And I hope we ain't too bloody late!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_7|"Arrest or rescue?
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_8|"Good work, Sergeant. By jinx, when I heard the Municipals were coming, I was scared they'd get him for sure. Crane wants to watch this guy shot in person!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_9|"You're overlooking something, Hendrix,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_10|"If you ever look at my record, you'll find I'm an ex-newspaperman myself. This is a rescue. Tie them up, Izzy."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_11|"And I hope nobody finds them,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_12|"All right, Randy, I guess we're a bunch of refugees heading for the outside, and bloody lucky at that. Proves a man shouldn't have friends."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_13|"Not to me, Izzy. Right now I can appreciate friends. But you two better get going. I've got some unfinished business to tend to.
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_14|"Either of you know where I can buy stencils and ink and find some kind of a truck to haul this paper along?"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_15|"Okay, Randy, we'll find them. Gov'nor, you'd better tell my mother I'll be using the old sheets. Go on. You've got the princess to worry about. We'll be along later."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_16|"Fanatics, crusaders and damned fools!
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_17|"And I packed your things, too."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_18|"I won't need them out there,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_19|"They'll be safe here."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_20|"So will you, now that you've made up with the Mother,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_21|"Your meal ticket's ruined, Cuddles, and you made it clear a little while ago just where you stand. Remind me to tell you sometime how much fun it's been."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_22|"Your mother was good with a soldering iron, wasn't she? You even look human.
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_23|"You might guess that the cops would be happy to get hold of your wife now, though. Come on, it's a long walk."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_24|"Going hunting for those damned kids, eh?
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_25|"Lucky devil! All I got for a guide was an old bum. Okay, luck, Sergeant!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_26|"Didn't know who it was. Sorry. Ever get that louse you were out for?"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_27|"Things are a mite tough out here, princess. No deliveries. Closed my bar, been living sort of hand to mouth, but not much mouth.
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_28|"I ain't so bad off. I ate something yesterday. But if you can spare something for the Kid -- Hey, Kid!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_29|"Shouldn't oughta. You'll need it. Umm.
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_30|"Kid can't talk. Cop caught him peddling one of Randolph's pamphlets, cut out part of his tongue. But he's all right now. Come on, Kid, hurry it up. We gotta convoy these people."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_31|"Any muckrakers there?"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_32|"Why didn't you two wait?
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_33|"I figured Izzy'd stop by first. Here, sit over there. Not much room, with my stuff and Randolph's, but it beats walking."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_34|"What in hell brings you back?
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_35|"A man gets tired of being respectable, cobber. And I'm getting old and sentimental about the Chicken Coop.
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_36|"But not so old that I can't handle a couple of guards that are stubborn about trucks, eh, Izzy?"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_37|"Messy, but nice,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_38|"Tell those trained apes of yours to cut the lights, will you, Mother? Somebody must be using the Coop."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_39|"They're all dead, cobbers,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_40|"Dead because a crook had to try his hand on a lock. Years ago, I had a flask of poison gas attached, in case a gang should ever squeeze me out."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_41|"Dope! And all that other stuff's ammunition!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_42|"A pigpen. They've ruined the Coop, cobber. Smell that air -- even I can smell it!
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_43|"Well, it'll give the boys something to do,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_44|"When a man gets old, he likes a little comfort, cobber. Nice things around him..."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_45|"I'll be cleaning for a week,
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_46|"What are you going to do now, Bruce?"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_47|"I was afraid you'd think of that, Gordon. Look, you never were a reporter -- you ran a column. I've read the stuff you wrote. You killed and maimed with words. But you never dug up news that would help people, or tell them what they didn't suspect all along. And that's what I've got to have."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_48|"Too bad Security didn't think I was as lousy a reporter as you do!"
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_49|"You all right, Bruce? I heard you tossing around."
7585.policeyourplanet_14_delray_64kb_50|"Just making plans for tomorrow."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_0|"Banks will be reopened as rapidly as the Legal Government can extend its control, and all deposits previously made will be honored in full."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_1|"Let them bribe us if they like. We're going to win this war."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_2|"Food, and some other stuff. There are some refuse bags, too. Yell when you want them removed."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_3|"Water! Two gallons!"
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_4|"There are heat tablets, and a skin tub.
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_5|"Detergent. The whole works."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_6|"I suppose I should thank you, but I don't like to be told I stink so much you can't stand me in the next room!"
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_7|"Hell, I've gotten so I can stand your grandfather,
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_8|"This will identify the bearer, BRUCE IRVING GORDON, as a PRIME agent of the Office of Solar Security, empowered to make and execute any and all directives under the powers of this office.
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_9|"You've got a visitor -- outside,
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_10|"Trench. And I don't like the stench of that kind of cop in my place. Get him away, cobber, get him away!"
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_11|"Good. At least some men are loyal. Had breakfast, Gordon?"
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_12|"What's the angle?"
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_13|"I'll have to trust you, Gordon. I've never been sure. But either you're loyal now or I can't depend on anyone being loyal."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_14|"So we're going to need men with guts. Gordon, you had training under Murdoch -- who knew his business. And you aren't a coward, as most of these fat fools are. I've got a proposition, straight from Wayne."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_15|"We're in enemy territory,
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_16|"The Legals got this precinct last night. Captain Hendrix and some of his men wanted to come back with full battle equipment and chase them out. I had a hell of a time getting them to take it easy. I suppose that was some damned fool who tried to go back to his beat."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_17|"Then you'd better look again,
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_18|"We've got to stop this. Get my car -- up the street -- call Arliss on the phone -- under the dash. Or Wayne. I'll bring Hendrix."
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_19|"Damn it, there's a rebellion going on!
7585.policeyourplanet_11_delray_64kb_20|"Yes, yes, congratulations. Trench was quite right; you're fully authorized. Did you call me out of bed just to check on that, young man?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_0|"Gordon reporting,
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_1|"Gordon? Where the hell you been?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_2|"Up an alley between McCutcheon and Miles,
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_3|"With a corpse. Murdoch's corpse. Better send out the wagon."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_4|"Okay, I'll be out in ten minutes."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_5|"Yeah. Claimed he was head of it here, and wanted me to send a message to Earth for him."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_6|"He must have been to spin that story ... By the way, thanks for killing that sniper. You're a good shot. I'd be dead if you weren't, I guess."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_7|"I could start a nasty investigation, I guess. But I heard him raving, too. Give me a hand, and I'll take care of all this ... Want me to drop you off?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_8|"Congratulations, by the way. I forgot to tell you, but you won the lottery. You're a sergeant from now on."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_9|"We thought you'd gone on the lam, cobber. But I guess, since Trench brought you back, you've cooled. Good, good. As a respectable man now, I couldn't have stashed you from the cops -- though I might have been tempted -- mighty tempted.
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_10|"Tell me, lad, did they get Murdoch?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_11|"I thought you were taking a bath,
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_12|"Fate's against me, cobber. With all the shooting, some punk put a bullet clean through the wall and the plastic of the tub. Fifty gallons of water, all wasted!"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_13|"I had odds you'd beat the ticket, though the Mother and me were worried there for a while. How'd you grease the fix?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_14|"What happened to you, Izzy?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_15|"Price of being honest. But the gees who paid me protection didn't get hurt, gov'nor.
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_16|"So they pay double tomorrow. Honesty pays, gov'nor, if you squeeze it once in a while ... Funny, you making sergeant; I thought two other gees won the lottery."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_17|"It's easy enough, and you'll get plenty of credit in the fund for it. I need two men who can keep their mouths shut."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_18|"That's it. Take tomorrow off, if you want, and I'll fix credit for you. But just remember you haven't seen anything. You don't know any more than our old friend Murdoch!"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_19|"Guns and contraband ammunition for the administration from Earth. And they must have paid half the graft they've taken for that. What the hell do they want it for?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_20|"War, what else? Gov'nor, Earth must be boiling about the election. Maybe Security's getting set to spring."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_21|"When do we get our money?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_22|"That's the way a panic is, cobber,
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_23|"There's a run, then everything is ruined. I tried to get you when I first heard the rumor, but you were gone. And when this starts, a man has to get there first.
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_24|"And I just made it, too."
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_25|"But what started it?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_26|"If we hold past midnight, we'll be set, gov'nor,
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_27|"They go crazy for a while, but give 'em a few hours and they stop most of it. I figure you know where all the scratch went?"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_28|"Sure -- guns from Earth! The damned fools!"
7585.policeyourplanet_09_delray_64kb_29|"Yeah. But not fools. Just bloody well-informed, gov'nor. Earth's sending a fleet -- got official word of it. No way of telling how big, but it's coming."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_0|"Mother got ahold of a load of snow, and sent me out to contact a big pusher. Coming back, the goons picked me up and gave me the job on you. Hey, Mother!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_1|"Izzy and Bruce. Didn't know you'd met, cobbers. Contact, Izzy?"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_2|"Ninety per cent for uncut,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_3|"Same old angles, eh? Get enough to do the job, they mug you. Stop halfway, and the halls are closed to you. Pretty soon, they'll be trick-proof, anyhow; they're changing over to electric eyes. Eh, you haven't forgotten me, cobber?"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_4|"Enough to buy a corporal's job, pay for your suit, and maybe get by,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_5|"Thanks, Mother, but I'll be staying inside the dome, I guess."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_6|"Now, with what I get from the pusher, I can buy off that hot spot on the police blotter. I can go in the dome and walk around, just like you.
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_7|"I'm getting old. They'll be calling me 'Grandmother' pretty soon. So I'm turning my Chicken House over to my granddaughter and I'm going honest. Want a room?"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_8|"Didn't know you had a granddaughter."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_9|"Special Taxes
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_10|"Your friend has no record with us,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_11|"I've checked through his tax forms, and they're all in order. We'll confirm officially, of course."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_12|"Save time, boys,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_13|"And time's valuable, ain't it? Ah, yes.
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_14|"And you'll want suits. Isaacs? Good, here's your receipt. And you, Corporal Gordon. Right. Get your suits one floor down, end of the hall. And report in eight tomorrow morning!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_15|"Hope they don't give us too bad territory, gov'nor,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_16|"Pickings are always a little lean on the first few beats, but you can work some fairly well."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_17|"Cripes! Hope they've got a few cheap pushers around that don't pay protection direct to the captain. You take that store; I'll go in this one!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_18|"New cop, eh? No wonder Gable collected yesterday, ahead of time. All right, you can look at my books. I've been paying fifty, but you'll have to wait until Friday."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_19|"That damned cop before us! He really tapped them! And we can't take less, so I guess we gotta wait until Friday."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_20|"You'd better call the hospital,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_21|"He may have a concussion. I've got the man who held you up."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_22|"I suppose it can't be helped, though; you're new, Gordon. Hennessy, get the corpse to the morgue, and mark it down as a robbery attempt. I'm going to have to book you and your men, Mr. Jurgens!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_23|"about the Mayor's campaign, or anything else,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_24|"Fifty per cent of the take to the Orphan's and Widow's fund. Better make it more than Gable turned in, if you want to get a better beat."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_25|"Voluntary Donations
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_26|"Widows and Orphans sure appreciate a good man,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_27|"I was kind of worried about you, Gordon, but you got a nice touch. One of my new boys -- Isaacs, you know him -- was out checking up after you, and the dopes seem to like you."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_28|"Special meeting tomorrow. We gotta see about getting out a good vote. Election only three weeks away."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_29|"We gotta be neutral, boys,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_30|"But it don't mean we can't show how well we like the Mayor. Just remember, he got us our jobs! Now I figure we can all kick in a little to help his campaign. I'm going to start it off with five thousand credits, two thousand of them right now."
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_31|"Freitag, what about you? Fine, fine!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_32|"Quite all right, Gordon,
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_33|"I guess that's all, boys. Thanks from the Mayor. And go on home.... Oh, Fell, Gordon, Lativsky -- stick around. I've got some overtime for you, since you need extra money. The boys out in Ward Three are shorthanded. Afraid I'll have to order you out there!"
7585.policeyourplanet_03_delray_64kb_34|"Rough, eh? But I hear robbery went down on your beat last night. Fine work, Gordon. We need men like you. Hate to do it, but I'm afraid you'll have to take the next shift at Main and Broad, directing traffic. The usual man is sick, and you're the only one I can trust with the job!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_0|"Special pass to leave at this hour,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_1|"Of course, if it's urgent, pal..."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_2|"Police Sergeant Gordon, on official business,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_3|"Get the hell out of my way."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_4|"And you'd better be ready to open when I come back."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_5|"You, Sheila, you come outa there! You come right out or I'm gonna blast that there door down. You open up."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_6|"Jurgens don't want you; all he wants is this place -- we got use for it. It don't belong to you, anyhow! Come out now, and we'll let you go peaceful. Or stay in there and we'll blast you out -- in pieces."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_7|"You don't have a chance. We've already chased all your boarders out!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_8|"We got them all."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_9|"Sure, baby. Open up!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_10|"Wait a minute. I've got this nailed shut.
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_11|"Though I ought to let you stay out there and rot. Damn it ... uh!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_12|"You!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_13|"And lucky for you, Cuddles."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_14|"Hello, O'Neill,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_15|"You ain't gonna beat me this time? I'm a sick man. Sick. Can't hurt nobody. Don't beat me again."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_16|"Just stay there until I get away from this rat's nest and I won't hit you. I won't even touch you."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_17|"Just a matter of co-ordination, Cuddles,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_18|"Little girls shouldn't play with knives; they'll grow up to be old maids that way."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_19|"Can't say I think much of your choice of companions these days,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_20|"It looks as if your grandfather picks them better for you."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_21|"I got enough out of the Mother to case the pitch,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_22|"I knew I was right when I spotted the apeman carrying a guy with a bad shoulder away from here. Jurgens' punks, eh?"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_23|"Thanks for coming. What's it going to cost me?"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_24|"Wouldn't be honest to charge unless you asked me to convoy you, gov'nor. And if you're looking for the vixen's room, it's where you bunked before. I got around after I spotted you here."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_25|"Traitor! Crooked little traitor!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_26|"Shut up, Sheila,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_27|"Your retainer ran out."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_28|"You're going bye-bye, Cuddles,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_29|"I'm going to put this on you and then unfasten your arms and legs. But if you start to so much as wiggle your big toe, you won't sit down for a month."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_30|"Very touching, cobber. You have a way with women, it seems. Too bad she had to wear a helmet, or you might have dragged her here by her hair. Ah, well, let's not talk about it here. My room is more comfortable -- and private."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_31|"Well? You must have had some reason for bringing her here, cobber."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_32|"I want her out of my hair, Mother,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_33|"I can lock her up -- carrying a gun without a permit is reason enough. But I'd rather you kept her here, if you'll take the responsibility. After all, she's your granddaughter."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_34|"So she is. That's why I wash my hands of her. I couldn't control myself at her age, couldn't control my son, and I don't intend to handle a female of my line. It looks as if you'll have to arrest her."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_35|"Okay. Suppose I rent a room and put a good lock on it. You've got the one that connects with mine vacant."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_36|"I run a respectable house now, Gordon,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_37|"What you do outside my place is your own business. But no women, except married ones. Can't trust 'em."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_38|"How in hell do I marry her without any rigmarole?"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_39|"Very convenient,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_40|"The two of you simply fill out a form -- I've got a few left from the last time -- and get Izzy and me to witness it. Drop it in the mail, and you're married."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_41|"Rich, but not very imaginative,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_42|"But she'll learn. Izzy, I have a feeling we should let them settle their differences."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_43|"This isn't a game. Hell's popping here -- you know that better than most people. And I'm up to my neck in it. If I've got to marry you to keep you out of my hair, I will."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_44|"So romantic,
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_45|"Me or Trench! I can take you to him and tell him you're mixed up in Security, and that you either have papers on you or out at the Chicken Coop to prove it. He won't believe you if I take you in. Well?"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_46|"You'd do it! You really would.... All right; I'll sign your damned papers!"
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_47|"It's in the mail to the register, along with the twenty credits. Gov'nor, we're about due to report in."
7585.policeyourplanet_10_delray_64kb_48|"I'll bring you some food tonight. And you may not have a private bath, but it beats the Chicken Coop. Here.
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_0|"You're a traitor, and we'd like nothing better than seeing your guts spilled,
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_1|"That paper you swiped was marked top secret. But we don't get many men with your background -- cop, tinhorn, fighter -- who have brains enough for our work. So you're bound for Mars, rather than the Mercury mines. If..."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_2|"And suppose nothing happens?
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_3|"Then who cares? You're just lucky enough to be alive."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_4|"And what makes you think I'm going to be a spy for Security?"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_5|"Why not, Gordon? You've been a spy for a yellow scandal sheet. Why not for us?"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_6|"Been here dozens of times, myself. Risking your life just to go into Marsport. Why Congress doesn't clean it up, I'll never know!"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_7|"... be at Mother Corey's soon,
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_8|"Notorious -- worst place on Mars. Take it from me, brother, that's something! Even the cops are afraid to go in there. See it? There, to your left!"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_9|"It's your life, buster,
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_10|"I'll give you five minutes to get into coveralls and helmet and out through the airlock."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_11|"You don't have to puncture my seal. You're in."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_12|"come on down. He's alone, anyhow. What's pushing, stranger?"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_13|"and a government allotment that'll last me two weeks in the dome. I figure on making it last six here, and don't let my being a firster give you hot palms. My brother was Lanny Gordon!"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_14|"Looking for a room?
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_15|"I'm looking for Mother Corey."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_16|"Then you're looking at him, cobber. Sleep on the floor, want a bunk, squat with four, or room and duchess to yourself?"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_17|"All yours, cobber, while your crackle's blue."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_18|"What about a lock on the door?
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_19|"What good would it do you? Got a different way here, we have. One credit a week, and you get Mother Corey's word nobody busts in. And it sticks, cobber -- one way or the other."
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_20|"Where does a man eat around here?"
7585.policeyourplanet_01_delray_64kb_21|"Eh? Oh. Eat. There's a place about ten blocks back. Cobber, stop teasing me! With elections coming up, and the boys loaded with vote money back in town -- with a deck of cheaters like that -- you want to eat?"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_0|"Why didn't you tell me you were a Security Prime! I'm grade three myself."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_1|"And I suppose that would have meant you'd have shipped in all the food we needed free?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_2|"Nope. You're right. The growers would starve next year if they gave it all away now. Well, we'll get in enough food this way to keep you going for a while -- couple of weeks, at least."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_3|"Go back! If just one of you gets within ten feet of the dome or entrance, we're going to rip the dome! We'll destroy Marsport before we'll give in to a doped-up crowd of riffraff! You've got five minutes to get out of sight, before we come out with rifles and knock you off! Now beat it!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_4|"They're bluffing. They wouldn't dare destroy the dome! Come on!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_5|"If the dome gives them a perfect cover, why let me make a jackass of myself, Mother?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_6|"Gave them something to live for here, cobber. And when you get over this, you're gonna announce new plans to try again. Yes, you are! But right now, you get yourself drunk!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_7|"Trench is outside in a heavy-armored car, Bruce. Says he wants to see you. Something to discuss -- a proposition!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_8|"Tell him to go to hell!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_9|"What did Trench want?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_10|"He wanted to show you a badge -- a Security badge made out for him,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_11|"All right, Cuddles,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_12|"You got your meal ticket, and you've outgrown it in this mess. Now I want that damned book! I've been operating in the dark. It's time I found out how to get in touch with some of those people. Where is it?"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_13|"It isn't. Bruce -- I don't have it. That time I gave you the note, you didn't come when I said, and I thought you wouldn't. Then Jurgens' men broke in, and I thought they'd get it, so -- so I burned it. I lied to you about using it to make you keep me."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_14|"Okay, Cuddles, you burned it. You were trying to kill me then, so you burned it to keep Jurgens from getting it and putting the finger on me! Where is it, Sheila? On you?"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_15|"No, Bruce. I burned it. I don't know why. I just did! No!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_16|"Are you satisfied now, you mechanical beast! Do you still think I have it on me?"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_17|"You don't. Don't you know a wife shouldn't keep secrets from her husband? A warm-blooded, affectionate husband, to boot.
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_18|"Better tell your husband where the book is, Cuddles!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_19|"Another week of being a failure on this planet of failures, and I might. Go ahead and tell me I'm the same as your first husband. If I can't even keep my word to you, I can at least get out and stay out.
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_20|"For your amusement, I'm going to miss having you around!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_21|"you meant it! You don't hate me any more.
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_22|"I don't think you're a failure. And maybe -- maybe I'm not. Maybe I don't have to be a failure as a woman -- a wife, Bruce. I don't want you to go!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_23|"The dome! It has to be the answer! Cuddles, you broke the chain enough for me to think again! We've been blind -- the whole damned planet has been blind."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_24|"I'm all right! I'm just half sane instead of all insane for a change.
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_25|"But what about this part of Marsport?"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_26|"We can work enough powder under those webbing supports, and lay the fuse wire beside the plastic ring that keeps it airtight,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_27|"But God help us, gov'nor, if any gee spots us."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_28|"Let him think we're just scouting,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_29|"Did you find them, cobber?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_30|"Not yet, Mother. May have to go back tonight."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_31|"The princess took off in a car three hours ago,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_32|"She said it was something that had to be done, gov'nor, so I figured you'd know about it."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_33|"Wire and explosive still there?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_34|"We might be able to run the wire in,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_35|"Who elected you chief martyr around here? You'll be blown up, gov'nor -- and if you ain't, they'll rip you to ribbons for knocking off the dome."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_36|"Get us back, Izzy,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_37|"We've got to round up whatever group we can and get them back here on the double. They must be counting on our original time, so they're in no hurry to remove the powder and wiring. But we can't count on any more time."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_38|"You're going through with it?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_39|"In one hour. And you might pass the word along that we're doing it to save the dome. Tell the men we just found out that Trench is losing and intends to blow it up instead of letting the Legals win."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_40|"Hear that siren, gov'nor? Means they're scared we may do it. Give me that damned switch!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_41|"Get back! The dome is mined! Any man comes near it, it'll blow! Get back! The dome is mined!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_42|"Your wife took a helluva chance, Gordon,
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_43|"And I took quite a chance, too, to set this up so nobody could ever believe you were behind it. Getting that fight started in time, after you first showed up -- oh, sure, we spotted you -- was the toughest job I ever did! But I guess Sheila had the roughest end, not even knowing for sure where I stood."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_44|"What happens to you now?
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_45|"They'll be blaming you for the end of the dome."
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_46|"Let them. I planned on that. Too bad Trench got torn to bits by the mob, isn't it? And it's a good thing I've always kept myself a place under a safe incognito out in the sticks. Got a wife and two kids out there that even Wayne didn't know about.
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_47|"You're like Security, Gordon. You do all the wrong things, but you get the right results. Goodbye!"
7585.policeyourplanet_16_delray_64kb_48|"He likes you, Bruce. But he can't say it. Men!"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_0|"No wonder the boys couldn't find where you'd stashed him, Mother. Must be a bloody big false section you've got in that trick mattress of yours!"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_1|"Big enough for him and for Trench, Izzy,
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_2|"Had to be big to fit me."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_3|"You mean you hid Trench out, too?
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_4|"I told you I had to do it. I take care of the side that pays my cut, and the bloody administration pulled the plug on my beat twice. Only honest thing to do was to join the Legals."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_5|"And get your rating upped to a lieutenant,
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_6|"Without telling cobber Gordon!"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_7|"Like I say, honesty pays, Mother -- when you know how to collect. Hell, I figured Bruce would do the same. He's a right gee."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_8|"Yeah, when he forgets he's a machine. How about a game of shanks?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_9|"Hello, Bruce. You okay?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_10|"How long have I been like this?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_11|"Fifteen hours, I guess. It's almost midnight.
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_12|"Are you hungry? There's some canned soup -- I took the money from your pocket. Or coffee..."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_13|"You were anxious enough to pick the lock and get out."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_14|"I didn't pick it -- you forgot to lock it."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_15|"Okay, my mistake. But why the change of heart?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_16|"Because I needed a meal ticket!
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_17|"When I saw that Legal cop ready to take you, I had to go running out to save you. Because I don't have the iron guts to starve like a Martian!"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_18|"I'll stick to my chances. I don't have any others now.
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_19|"You get things done. Now that you've got a wife to support, you'll support her. Just remember, it was your idea."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_20|"I've got a wife who's holding onto a notebook that belongs to me, then. Where is it?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_21|"I'm keeping the notebook for insurance. Blackmail, Bruce. You should understand that! And you won't find it, so don't bother looking...
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_22|"Special prisoners,
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_23|"I've got to get information to Trench -- and in private!"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_24|"Oh, it's you, Gordon?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_25|"Where's Captain Trench?"
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_26|"Commissioner Trench, Gordon. It seems Arliss decided to get rid of Mayor Wayne, but didn't count on Wayne's spies being better than his. So Trench got promoted -- and I got his job for loyal service in helping the Force recruit. My boys always wanted to be cops, you know."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_27|"I sent Ape and Mullins out to get in touch with you,
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_28|"But I guess they didn't reach you before you left."
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_29|"They hadn't arrived when I left the house,
7585.policeyourplanet_12_delray_64kb_30|"Captain Bruce Gordon, with two prisoners -- bodyguards of Captain Jurgens,
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_0|"On the house, copper,
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_1|"And bring out a steak, there! You look as if you could stand it -- and Fats don't forget old friends!"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_2|"Friends and other things,
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_3|"Maybe you should have got me that night, Fats."
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_4|"Guess I'll have to stick to selling meals, mostly -- for a while, at least. Somebody told me you'd joined Security and got banged up trying to keep Trench from blowing up the dome. Thought you'd be in the chips!"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_5|"Why don't you pull off the planet, Fats? You could go back to Earth, I'd guess."
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_6|"Hello, Gordon. Finally got our orders for you. It's Mercury!"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_7|"All right. I suppose you know I ruined the dome, was supposed to have killed Murdoch, pretended I was a Security agent..."
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_8|"I wonder if it's worth it,
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_9|"So I get sent to Mercury?"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_10|"You can't stay here. They'll find out too much eventually.
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_11|"All right. But I wish you'd tell my wife sometime that -- well, that I didn't just run out on her. She's had bad luck with men."

7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_13|"I've been waiting for you quite a while, you know. And I've paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge. She's out shopping!"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_14|"Did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off, cobber?
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_15|"And after I took a bath to celebrate? I -- I -- Oh, drat it, I'm getting old. Izzy, you tell him."
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_16|"I can't say it, either, gov'nor -- but some day, I'm going to have one of those badges myself. Like I always said, honesty sure pays, even if it kills you. Here!"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_17|"I've been shopping and I spent the money the man gave me. This is all I have left. Do you think it's worth it? Or should I take it back?"
7585.policeyourplanet_17_delray_64kb_18|"You got a bargain, Cuddles,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_0|"Can you go with me at once, Alida?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_1|"That's sensible. Perhaps you had better get your things ready while I and Mr. Watterly go and arrange with Justice Harkins."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_2|"I haven't anything, sir, but a hat and cloak to put on. I came away and left everything."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_3|"And I'm glad of it,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_4|"I wouldn't want you to bring anything which that scoundrel gave you.
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_5|"It's settled, Tom. Alida will be Mrs. Holcroft as soon as we can see the justice. Do you think we could persuade him to come here?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_6|"One thing at a time. Mrs. Holcroft, -- I may as well call you so, for when my friend says he'll do a thing he does it, -- I congratulate you. I think you are well out of your troubles. Since you are to marry my old friend, we must be friends, too,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_7|"You were the first friend I found, sir, after -- what happened,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_8|"I should hope so,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_9|"You've taken time enough, certainly, and I guess you've talked more than you have before in a year."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_10|"Oh, yes, indeed, sir! I don't want to meet strangers -- and -- and -- I'm not very strong yet. I thank you for considering my feelings so kindly."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_11|"Why, that's my duty,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_12|"Come, Watterly, the sun is getting low, and we've considerable to do yet before we start home."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_13|"I'm with you. Now, Alida, you go back quietly and act as if nothing had happened till I send for you. Of course this impatient young groom will hurry back with the justice as fast as possible. Still, we may not find him, or he may be so busy that we shall have to come back for you and take you to his office."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_14|"Now don't you be nervous or worried. I see you are not strong, and you shall not be taxed any more than I can help. Goodby for a little while."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_15|"You're in for it now, Jim, sure enough,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_16|"What will Angy say to it all?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_17|"Tell her that I say you've been a mighty good friend to me, yet I hope I may never return any favors of the same kind."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_18|"By jocks! I hope not. I guess it's just as well she was away. She'll think we've acted just like two harum-scarum men, and will be awfully scandalized over your marrying this woman. Don't you feel a little nervous about it?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_19|"No! When my mind's made up, I don't worry. Nobody else need lie awake for it's my affair."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_20|"Well, Jim, you know how I feel about it, but I've got to say something and I might as well say it plain."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_21|"That's the only way you ought to say it."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_22|"I understand, Tom. We won't come till Mrs. Watterly asks us."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_23|"But you won't have hard feelings?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_24|"No, indeed. Aint you doing your level best as a friend?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_25|"Well, you know women are so set about these things, and Angy is rather hard on people who don't come up to her mark of respectability. What's more, I suppose you'll find that others will think and act as she does. If you cared about people's opinions I should have been dead against it, but as you feel and are situated, I'm hanged if I don't think she's just the one."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_26|"If it hadn't been this one, I don't believe it would have been anyone. Here we are,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_27|"Oh, bring her here! And I'll invite in some of the boys as witnesses."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_28|"I'm not afraid of all the witnesses that you could crowd into a ten-acre lot,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_29|"but there is no occasion to invite the boys, whoever they are, or anyone else. She doesn't want to be stared at. I was in hopes, Mr. Harkins, that you'd ride up to the almshouse with us and quietly marry us there."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_30|"See here, Ben,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_31|"Holcroft is my friend, and you know I'm mighty thick with my friends. They count more with me than my wife's relations. Now I want you to do what Holcroft wishes, as a personal favor to me, and the time will come when I can make it up to you."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_32|"Oh, certainly, Watterly! I didn't understand,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_33|"I'll go with you at once. It's but a short job."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_34|"how short can you make it?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_35|"Let me get my book,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_36|"Justice's Assistant.
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_37|"You can't want anything shorter than this?
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_38|"'By this act of joining hands you do take each other as husband and wife and solemnly engage in the presence of these witnesses to love and honor and comfort and cherish each other as such so long as you both shall live. Therefore, in accordance with the law of the state of New York I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife.' A sailor couldn't tie a knot quicker than that."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_39|"I guess you can, justice,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_40|"Suppose you only read this much: 'By this act of joining hands you do take each other as husband and wife. Therefore, in accordance with the law, etc.' Would that be a legal marriage?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_41|"Certainly. You'd have to go to a divorce court to get out of that."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_42|"It's my purpose to keep out of courts of all kinds. I'll thank you to read just that much and no more. I don't want to say anything that isn't exactly true."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_43|"You see how it is, Ben. Holcroft hasn't known the woman long, and she's a nice woman, too, if she is boarding at my hotel. Holcroft needs a wife -- must have one, in fact, to help run his house and dairy. It wasn't exactly a love match, you know; and he's that kind of a man that a yoke of oxen couldn't draw a word out of him that he didn't mean."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_44|"Yes, yes, I see now,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_45|"I'll read just what you say and no more."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_46|"And I'll have a little spread that we can be longer at than the ceremony,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_47|"You're right, Jim. I didn't think, and one doesn't have much cause to be so sparing of the feelings of such creatures as come here. But she's out of the common run, and I ought to have remembered it. By jocks! You're mighty careful about promising to love, cherish, and obey, and all that, but I guess you'll do a sight more than many who do promise."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_48|"Of course I'm going to be kind. That's my duty. Give Harkins a hint. Tell him that she's lost her mother. He needn't know when the old lady died, but it will kind of solemnize him."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_49|"Courage! It will be over in a minute."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_50|"do you enter into this marriage freely and without compulsion of any kind?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_51|"Please let me sit down a moment,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_52|"I'm not one to break my word. Home and quiet will soon restore you. Answer the justice and tell him the exact truth."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_53|"I have consented to Mr. Holcroft's wishes with feelings of the deepest gratitude."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_54|"Very well. Join hands."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_55|"It's all right, Alida,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_56|"'By this act of joining hands you do take each other as husband and wife. Therefore, in accordance with the law of the State of New York, I do hereby pronounce you husband and wife.' That's all."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_57|"I don't think you'll ever be sorry, Alida,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_58|"you must all come out now to a little supper, and also remember that it was gotten up in a hurry."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_59|"you'll want to make some purchases. You know she's only what she wears. How are you off for money?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_60|"Of course I know it. Will fifty answer?"
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_61|"Yes. You're a good friend. I'll return it in a day or two."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_62|"Return it when you're a mind to. I say, Alida, I want you to take this. Jim Holcroft can't get married and his bride not receive a present from me,
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_63|"Now see here, Tom, you've done too much for us already."
6593.hefellinlovewithhiswife_19_roe_64kb_64|"Shut up, Jim Holcroft! Don't you end the day by hurting my feelings! It's perfectly right and proper for me to do this. Goodby, Alida. I don't believe you'll ever be sorry you found your way to my hotel."
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_0|“There isn't any table to set,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_1|“there isn't anybody to eat anything, Davie; you and Joel can get something out of the cupboard.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_2|“Can we get whatever we've a mind to, ma?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_3|“we'll have a breakfast!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_4|“eat the whole, Joey.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_5|“When were you taken?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_6|“Didn't you feel badly before?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_7|“And those eyes of yours have been used too much; what has she been doing, ma'am?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_8|“and everything; Polly does everything, sir.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_9|“well, she won't again in one spell; her eyes are very bad.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_10|“Don't make my Polly sick! oh! please don't!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_11|“We're going to make Polly well, little girl; so that she can see splendidly.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_12|“we'll try hard; and you mustn't cry; 'cause then Polly'll cry, and that will make her eyes very bad; very bad indeed,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_13|“no, not one bit.
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_14|“If 'twas anythin' but my eyes, mammy, I could stand it,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_15|“and who'll do all the work now?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_16|“Don't think of the work, Polly,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_17|“I can't do anything but think,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_18|“Do go out, mother, and see what 'tis,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_19|“to set by you a spell; what's the matter?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_20|“Oh, Polly's taken,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_21|“what is it -- a fit?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_22|“the same as Ben's got; and Phronsie; the measles.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_23|“The measles, has she?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_24|“well, that's bad; and Ben's away, you say.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_25|“No, he isn't either,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_26|“he's got them, too!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_27|“Got two what?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_28|“Measles! he's got the measles too,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_29|“Oh! the dreadful!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_30|“and this girl too?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_31|“and I'm not going to, either.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_32|“Oh, dear,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_33|“that's what Polly said; and she's got 'em bad. It's her eyes,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_34|“well, I've got a receet that cousin Samanthy's folks had when John's children had 'em; and I'll run right along home and get it,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_35|“No, you needn't,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_36|“thank you, Mrs. Bascom; but Dr. Fisher's been here; and he put something on Polly's eyes; and he said it mustn't be touched.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_37|“You come along of me,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_38|“I've got some peppermints to home; I forgot to bring 'em.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_39|“Where you going, Joe?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_40|“Oh, I've got to go over to grandma's,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_41|“Well, don't be gone long then,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_42|“There now, you take these home; you may have some, but be sure you give the most to the sick ones; and Polly -- let Polly have the biggest.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_43|“She won't take 'em,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_44|“Well, you try her,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_45|“I don't want 'em, Joe,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_46|“twas peppermints, real peppermints;
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_47|“Try one, Polly; they're real good,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_48|“there, open your mouth.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_49|“real good; where'd you get 'em?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_50|“Over to Grandma Bascom's,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_51|“she gave me lots for all of us; have another, Polly?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_52|“not yet; you put two on my pillow where I can reach 'em; and then you keep the rest, Joel.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_53|“I'll put three,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_54|“And I want another, Joey, I do,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_55|“Well, you may have one,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_56|“a red one, Phronsie; yes, you may have two. Now come on, Dave; we'll have the rest out by the wood-pile.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_57|“it's Mrs. Henderson!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_58|“oh! I'm so glad! is Miss Jerushy with her?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_59|“why, it's the parson himself! Deary! how we look!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_60|“I'm sorry to hear the children are sick,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_61|“until this morning -- can we see them?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_62|“Ben's upstairs; and Polly and Phronsie are in here.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_63|“Poor little things!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_64|“hadn't you better,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_65|“go up and see Ben first, while I will visit the little girls?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_66|“I've come to see my little chicken now!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_67|“I know,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_68|“but it's for you to bear patiently, Polly -- what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I came away?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_69|“I don't know, ma'am,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_70|“please tell us.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_71|“Well, they were all fighting over a grasshopper -- yes, ten of them.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_72|“oh! I hope the white one did!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_73|“Well, he looked as much like winning as any of them,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_74|“she's a parson's wife, I say!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_75|“this is the little girl who came to see me when I was sick.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_76|“I'm so glad you wasn't!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_77|“Well, when I come again,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_78|“I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket, and read for those poor eyes.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_79|“Oh, thank you!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_80|“Well, what is it?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_81|“Ben loves to hear reading,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_82|“Does he? well, by that time, my little girl, I guess Ben will be down-stairs; he's all right, Polly; don't you worry about him -- and I'll sit in the kitchen, by the bedroom door, and you can hear nicely.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_83|“I know she's -- and there isn't any use keeping it from me,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_84|“she's going to be stone-blind!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_85|“My good woman,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_86|“your little girl will not be blind; I tell you the truth; but it will take some time to make her eyes quite strong -- time, and rest. She has strained them in some way, but she will come out of it.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_87|“Praise the Lord!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_88|“and thank you, sir -- I can't ever thank you -- for -- for -- if Polly was blind, we might as well give up!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_89|“Oh, I want on my very best shoes,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_90|“Oh, no, Phronsie; you must keep them nice,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_91|“you can't wear 'em every-day, you know.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_92|“it's only one day.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_93|“Well, and then you'll want 'em on again tomorrow,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_94|“never, no more to-morrow, if I can have 'em to-day; please, mammy dear!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_95|“My own, very own shoes! whole mine!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_96|“new shoes! I declare!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_97|“and they've got red tops, too!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_98|“beautiful red tops, aren't they?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_99|“Be-yew-ti-ful,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_100|“Does Polly have new shoes every day?
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_101|“Oh, no, she don't have anything, Polly don't.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_102|“And what does Polly want most of all -- do you know? see if you can tell me.
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_103|“you're the girl for me! to think you know! so, what is it?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_104|“A stove!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_105|“why, she's got one.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_106|“it won't burn; and sometimes Polly cries, she does, when she's all alone -- and I see her.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_107|“that's too bad; that is! and then what does she do?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_108|“Oh, Ben stuffs it up,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_109|“and so does Polly too, with paper; and then it all tumbles out quick; oh! just as quick!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_110|“Do you suppose,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_111|“we'll lookout for to-morrow, then.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_112|“Oh, dear, I can't bear it!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_113|“since dinnertime! If Ben were only well, to talk to me.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_114|“Oh, I say, Polly,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_115|“Ben's a-comin' down the stairs!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_116|“you shouldn't have told; he wanted to surprise Polly.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_117|“mammy, can't I take off this horrid bandage, and see him?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_118|“Dear me, no!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_119|“not for the world, Polly! Dr. Fisher'd have our ears off!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_120|“Well, I can hear, any way,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_121|“here he is! oh, Ben!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_122|“now we're all right; and say, Polly, you're a brick!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_123|“Mammy told me not to say that the other day,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_124|“you're so comfortable together, and Phronsie don't want me now, I'll go to the store; I must get some more work if Mr. Atkins'll give it to me.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_125|“I'll be all right now, mammy, that Ben's here,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_126|“I'm goin' to tell her stories, ma,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_127|“so you needn't worry about us.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_128|“Isn't it funny, Ben,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_129|“to be sitting still, and telling stories in the daytime?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_130|“Well, do go on,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_131|“Well; once upon a time,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_132|“however do you think of such nice things!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_133|“I've had time enough to think, the last week,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_134|“to last a life-time!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_135|“Don't hurry him so,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_136|“he isn't strong.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_137|“did he really see a bear?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_138|“oh! where was I?”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_139|“Why, you said Tommy heard a noise,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_140|“and he thought it was a bear.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_141|“Oh, yes,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_142|“Oh, make it a bear, Ben!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_143|“don't let it be not a bear.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_144|“twouldn't sound true.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_145|“Never mind, make it sound true,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_146|“you can make anything true.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_147|“I suppose I must.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_148|“Make it two bears, Ben,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_149|“Oh, no, Phronsie, that's too much,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_150|“that'll spoil it; but make it a big bear, do Ben, and have him bite him somewhere, and most kill him.”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_151|“Well, I declare,
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_152|“if this isn't comfortable!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_153|“we've had a bear! a real, live bear, we have! Ben made him!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_154|“now, that's nice!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_155|“Oh, mammy!
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_156|“it does seem so good to be all together again!”
2199.fivelittlepeppers_06_sidney_64kb_157|“And I thank the Lord!
